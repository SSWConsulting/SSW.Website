                            <h1>[<span class="magazineTitle">the cutting edge</span> ]</h1>
                            <p><b>G'day Developers!</b></p>
                            <p>Recently Lei Xu and I completed a hair-raising TFS 2012 project. We hit some snags trying
                                to optimize Work Items with 20,000,000 records. Let me tell you the story...</p>

                            <p>
                                It was completed shortly after arriving home from the <a title="MVP Summit"
                                    href="https://www.2013mvpsummit.com/">MVP Summit</a> in Redmond.
                                It was lucky we were full of information from Brian Harry and his team. This job turned
                                out to be one of the most challenging that I've ever done,
                                pushing the performance limits of Team Foundation Server 2012 (these tips apply to TFS
                                2013 and 2010 as well).
                            </p>

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                First some background: the client runs one of the biggest development teams in the
                                world. They have over 20,000 developers and have a lot of experience gathering,
                                analyzing and acting on performance metrics acquired while testing software prior to
                                wide scale deployment.
                                The system we needed to implement and customize had to cope with a massive number of
                                concurrent requests, of course in very timely fashion.
                                We used the TFS Integration Platform and the TFS Object Model to implement most of the
                                functionality required.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Initially we thought TFS should be able to handle the load without too many problems,
                                because Microsoft has been
                                <a

                                for a long time, with great results.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, like every story, things will never run as you expect. Once the coding was
                                done, with all the data access, business logic and interface implementations on top
                                of TFS Object Model, it was time for the 1<sup>st</sup> performance tests.
                            </p>

                            <p>The initial results were disappointing...</p>

                                and live demos.
                                Both C# and VB.NET code is provided side-by-side giving the students a deeper
                                understanding of the commonalities between the languages.

                                Rather than spending weeks creating a prototype in code, Indigo Studio is a FREE tool
                                that allows you to rapidly iterate and validate designs
                                by creating interactive prototypes.

                            <p>Jason will show how to create prototypes and share them as an interactive HTML5 app that
                                can then be used to allow users to test on a variety of devices.</p>

                                Have you ever found times where you just want to write and execute some C# code and you
                                ask yourself Do I really need an IDE? a solution? a project? a class?
                                Do I really need to compile? Why do I have to worry about all these dlls? if you've done
                                any development with dynamic languages like Ruby, Python or node.js the
                                answer is you don't. But what about C#? scriptcs (https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs)
                                is new way to develop C# applications as script. It leverages compiler
                                advancements of Roslyn and combines the power of nuget to offer a low calorie approach
                                to working with C#. It's great for prototyping, simple scripting or even
                                building simple apps. Not only does it let you write scripted "apps", but it also
                                includes a REPL so you can execute code interactively. You can even debug.
                                Come to this talk and it will change the way you think about C# development.

                                Javascript, it's not just for browsers anymore. If you are a Javascript developer today
                                you are no longer confined to the browser frame, you can take those
                                skills to mobile devices, servers and the cloud. The technology makes it possible, but
                                it's not easy. You've got a lot of learning to do and a lot of things to
                                worry about like data, identity, validation, push, scale and diagnostics to name a few.
                                Azure Mobile Services is there to make it easy. It provides you a ton of
                                backend services out of the box to help you cloud enable those client apps utilizing the
                                client side Javascript skills you already have. If you are a node developer
                                you can go even further. It doesn't stop there though, it includes client SDKs for IOS,
                                Android, WIndows 8 and a newly announced library for Phonegap/HTML5 which
                                you can use to reach any device anywhere. You have to just see it to believe it, and if
                                you come to this talk you will!
