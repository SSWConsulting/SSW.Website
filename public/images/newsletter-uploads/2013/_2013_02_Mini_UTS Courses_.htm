							<p>UTS has the proud distinction of being the first academic institution in the world to teach
								participants to develop on the .NET Framework with Visual Studio 2012.
								The .NET Framework is one of the leading Microsoft development platforms for Windows and Web
								applications and this short course aims to introduce attendees to the latest Microsoft Development
								platform Visual Studio 2012.</p>
							<p>The framework improves on Java's capabilities, providing an API for multiple languages to generate and
								communicate with each other through the Common Language Runtime(CLR).
								Conceptually, .NET languages are not much different to traditional OO languages, however, students and
								programmers may need a short training course to understand its capabilities, the functionalities, the
								object and communication structure for these services and the best practices surrounding these
								technologies.</p>
							<p>In this course, participants will be exposed to C# as well as learn how to rapidly create data driven
								forms on the web and on windows.</p>
