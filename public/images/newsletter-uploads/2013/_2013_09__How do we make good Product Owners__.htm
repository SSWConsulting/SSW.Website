                            <p><b>How do we make good Product Owners?</b><br />
                                At my TechEd talks this month (Australia and New Zealand) I talked about Product Owners.
                                After my session there was lots of discussion around the
                                Product Owner Scrum role, and what makes a good one. I loved hearing the stories of
                                dysfunction about Product Owners who have not done their job well.</p>

                            <p>The client is generally the Product Owner (PO). They should read the Scrum Guide, watch
                                my new <a href="https://tv.ssw.com/3244/what-is-a-product-owner">Product
                                    Owner video</a> and communicate an understanding of their role. It is so important
                                to the success of their project.</p>

                                        Scrums</a>. This is optional but means that the PO will have daily insight into
                                    the team’s progress. </li>
                                <li>Understand Product Backlog Items (PBIs) and be able to explain what they want using
                                    <a

                                        Criteria</a>.
                                    This is the main way that developers and POs sync their understanding of what needs
                                    to be done. </li>
                                <li>Agree on a Sprint Goal for each sprint. </li>
                                <li>Not influence (or anchor) developer estimates with comments like "this one will be
                                    easy" and allow the team to come up with converged estimates. </li>
                                <li>Respect the <a
                                        href="https://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/Do-you-create-a-Sprint-Forecast-email.aspx">Sprint
                                        Goal</a>. Understand that the team will only work on things in the Sprint
                                    Backlog and don't expect other things to be done as well. Most things can wait for
                                    the next sprint.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><b>Who should be the Product Owner?</b><br />
                                It's hard to give guidance on who in the company would make a good PO. The usual
                                candidate is often extremely busy. It should be:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Someone with a personal stake in the success of the project.</li>
                                <li>Someone who is available</li>
                                <li>Someone with a clear vision of the product,</li>
                                <li>Someone who has authority with budget<br />
                                    e.g. They could authorise adding a designer to a sprint for a couple of days</li>
                                <li>Someone who has read the Scrum Guide and watched the Product Owner video and
                                    understands the role.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>It's possible to outsource the role of PO to someone in the development consulting
                                company, but this is not
                                recommended. Don't put the fox in charge of the chickens.</p>

                            <p>In this SSW TV Special, we converted the ‘Product Owner’ definition from the 2013 Scrum
                                Guide into cartoon form to illustrate the role of a Product Owner in a Scrum team.</p>

                            <p>(From the 2013 Scrum Guide)
                                <br />The Product Owner
                            </p>

                            <p>The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of
                                the Development Team.
                                How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.</p>

                            <P>The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.
                                Product Backlog management includes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Clearly expressing Product Backlog items; </li>
                                <li>Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions; </li>
                                <li>Ensuring the value of the work the Development Team performs; </li>
                                <li>Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and
                                    shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and, </li>
                                <li>Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level
                                    needed. </li>
                            </ul>

                                Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team Foundation
                                Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft
                                .NET platform. These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful
                                projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth
                                software development process.</p>

                                Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 ALM (formerly Team System) Team System is an integrated

                            <p>Too many web sites are neither optimized nor adapted to render well on mobile devices and
                                too many developers think it only needs some CSS.</P>

                            <P>Responsive Web Design (RWD) delivers multi-device views without extra costs, but what if
                                you have workflows to implement or different use-cases?
                                The session discusses a few real examples where RWD is not enough and server-side
                                detection is necessary.</p>
