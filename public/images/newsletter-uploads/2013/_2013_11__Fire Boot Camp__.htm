                            <h1>[<span class="magazineTitle">the cutting edge</span> ]</h1>
                            <p><b>G'day Developers!</b></p>
                            <p><b>From zero to .NET hero in 9 weeks with Fire Bootcamp</b><br /></p>

                            <p>I am proud to announce the launch of the best training course we have ever done. It takes
                                a beginner .NET developer to a *Job Ready* world class junior developer in 9 weeks.</p>

                            <p>Long story short, they get thrown into the fire, continuously mentored, while building a
                                real world app. They will successfully complete 4 sprints. I called it
                                <a href="https://www.firebootcamp.com/">FireBootCamp</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>I've approached this very differently from all the training SSW has done for many years
                                for companies around Australia. It has aspects of the best practices we’ve learnt
                                presenting at conferences around the world and lecturing at the University of Technology
                                Sydney for many years. We all learn better by doing, and working with others.
                                The successful applicants become "Fire Boot Campers" spending 40-60 hours per week for 9
                                weeks. They will learn the right way to do .NET Enterprise applications using
                                a series of patterns and best practices. Most teams will build an ASP.NET MVC app all
                                the way from concept to deployment.</p>

                            <p>No one will get stuck. No one will go down the wrong path. They will be mentored by an
                                SSW Solution Architect each day during the program and we believe this is one of
                                the keys to success. Having an experienced architect help them get over the hurdles when
                                they get stuck, teaching them best practices and pushing them to work hard
                                and work smart, will turn these new recruits into job ready coders.</p>

                            <p><strong>Employers:</strong> At the end of the program we welcome you to join our Gala
                                night where the students will show off the apps they have built. You will
                                have the first opportunity to add a "FireBootCamper" to your team. So if you are looking
                                to hire a passionate junior world class developer, then register at
                                <a

                                and be a part of the Gala night on 15th February 2013 at 2-6pm

                                Professional Scrum Developer courses teach students how to work in a team - using modern

                                an increment of potentially releasable functionality using a specific technology
                                platform.

                            <p>PhoneGap enables developers to build mobile apps for a variety of platforms using web
                                tools and frameworks. PhoneGap just works and delivers all
                                of its promises. However, a PhoneGap application is inherently tied up to the
                                performance of the browser and a relatively device agnostic user
                                interface. Is this a problem? Or is this part, or all, of the solution to the
                                long-standing problem of minimizing costs of multi-platform apps?
                                To properly try to answer the question it is essential to get a deeper grasp of how the
                                PhoneGap platform work and explore its technical details.
                                That would give you a hardly debatable list of pros and cons upon which you can
                                calculate your own tradeoffs.</p>

                            <p><b>Talk #1 - Kanban for Developers</b><br />
                                There is much hype about Kanban since it was perfected and introduced to the world by
                                Toyota. Since then, not only manufacturers but all businesses
                                looked into this simple but extremely powerful approach.
                            <p>

                            <p>As software developers are yearning for better project management and visibility on all
                                aspects of their work, Kanban naturally blipped on their radar.</p>

                            <p>In this session, we will look at the origins of Kanban, how it applies to software
                                development along with misunderstandings and myths. We will also compare
                                manufacturing practices with software development techniques and see how we can benefit
                                from their experiences. During the session we will have some interactive
                                exercises to help us better understand Kanban and becoming more efficient and productive
                                by limiting the amount of work we do.</p>

                            <p><b>Talk #2 - Kaizen: Continuous Process Improvement</b><br />
                                Enterprises can utilize Process Improvement to improve their workflow, allowing them to
                                be more efficient, eliminate bottlenecks and problem areas, and as a
                                result, achieve reduced costs, on-time delivery and increased profits. Currently,
                                enterprises are facing stiffer competition to win customer acceptance through
                                quality, and the need to develop more customer-oriented products and services faster
                                than ever before.</p>

                            <p>Einstein said "We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we
                                created them.", and that is what lies at the heart of Kaizen.
                                Improvement comes with a different look at the problems and doing this continuously
                                every day and everywhere. It is more of a company culture than a project.</p>

                            <p>But where do we start improving? British comic writer Douglas Adams said "See first,
                                think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will only
                                see what you were expecting.". And that is exactly where we start. By looking deep into
                                our workflow and process.</p>

                            <p>In this session, we will look at Kaizen philosophy, why change is important and very hard
                                to do. we'll also analyze waste and why it is bad for our business
                                and see how quality-first approach makes us better at what we do. I will also provide
                                some test cases and finish off by looking into implementing a Kaizen culture
                                at the office by involving everybody.

                            <p>As software developers are yearning for better project management and visibility on all
                                aspects of their work, Kanban naturally blipped on their radar.</p>

                            <p>In this session, we will look at the origins of Kanban, how it applies to software
                                development along with misunderstandings and myths. We will also compare
                                manufacturing practices with software development techniques and see how we can benefit
                                from their experiences. During the session we will have some interactive
                                exercises to help us better understand Kanban and becoming more efficient and productive
                                by limiting the amount of work we do.</p>

                            <p><b>Talk #2 - Kaizen: Continuous Process Improvement</b><br />
                                Enterprises can utilize Process Improvement to improve their workflow, allowing them to
                                be more efficient, eliminate bottlenecks and problem areas, and as a
                                result, achieve reduced costs, on-time delivery and increased profits. Currently,
                                enterprises are facing stiffer competition to win customer acceptance through
                                quality, and the need to develop more customer-oriented products and services faster
                                than ever before.</p>

                            <p>Einstein said "We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we
                                created them.", and that is what lies at the heart of Kaizen.
                                Improvement comes with a different look at the problems and doing this continuously
                                every day and everywhere. It is more of a company culture than a project.</p>

                            <p>But where do we start improving? British comic writer Douglas Adams said "See first,
                                think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will only
                                see what you were expecting.". And that is exactly where we start. By looking deep into
                                our workflow and process.</p>

                            <p>In this session, we will look at Kaizen philosophy, why change is important and very hard
                                to do. we'll also analyze waste and why it is bad for our business
                                and see how quality-first approach makes us better at what we do. I will also provide
                                some test cases and finish off by looking into implementing a Kaizen culture
                                at the office by involving everybody.

                                access Azure from the command line and deploy and redeploy with Git.
                                We'll fire up Linux VMs, setup Mongo and run node.js apps in the cloud. We'll look at
                                things like SendGrid and New Relic. The future of the cloud is open and it's a hybrid.
                                We'll also pinch pennies in the cloud and look at how our mindset needs to change if the
                                cloud is to save us money.</p>
