                            <p>Guys, I'm happy to tell you that we have completely redesigned SSW TV and I'd love if you
                                could spare a few moments to take a look!</p>

                            <p><a href="https://tv.ssw.com/" target="_blank">https://tv.ssw.com/</a></p>

                            <p>Here are the top 3 changes I think you will like:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Quizzes:</strong> We wanted to provide more value to the viewer and give
                                    them an opportunity to reinforce the key points of the video. Now you can take a
                                    short quiz. Go ahead and test your knowledge!</li>
                                <li><strong>TV Format:</strong> We have finally ditched the blog format. See how the
                                    content is now more accessible in our new TV-friendly format with the playlist down
                                    the right, showing the newest 16 releases. I preferred the scroll stopped when it
                                    got to #16, but I lost that argument and it now revolves endlessly.</li>
                                <li><strong>Navigate by Technology:</strong> Say you want to see all the SharePoint
                                    videos? Now just click "SharePoint" in the new section on the bottom right "Navigate
                                    by Topic"</li>
                            </ol>

                            <P>The latest versions of Visual Studio and TFS bring some great new features for
                                developers, Product Owners, testers, and even the crusty old stakeholders.
                                More than ever, TFS integrates the whole ALM story to help you deliver your project on
                                time and on budget.</p>

                            <p>In this session, we’ll quickly recap the best features of TFS 2012 and then look at the
                                great new features in TFS 2013. Adam Cogan will show you the new
                                ALM features that make TFS perfect for Product Owners and company Stakeholders, and how
                                developers work with TFS more effectively than ever, right from Visual Studio.
                                The session finishes off with an awesome story for testers.</p>

                            <p>This is probably the most confronting interview we have done at SSW TV!</p>

                            <p>SSW has just spent 8 months building the first release of a transport management system
                                for a major Australian transport company.
                                Join the Product Owner (client) and the lead developer as they hold a live retrospective
                                reflecting on what went well and what could be improved.</p>

                            <p>The project was a time and materials engagement using scrum. This warts and all interview
                                is your opportunity to get a behind the scenes look at
                                the scrum process from the perspectives of a client and a developer. You will hear
                                honest feedback of the pros and cons of scrum from both parties.</p>

                            <p>The webinar will be hosted by Keith Longworth and SSW's own Marlon Marescia and Gerard
                                Beckerleg.</p>
