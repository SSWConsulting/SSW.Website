					In this session we look at a fast-paced collection of indexing tips

					impact on that table's performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once the base table structures have been defined and you have to
					further improve system performance, where do you look and how do you
					do this?
				</p>
				<p>
					We will also talk about targeting both the known and finding the
					unknown performance problems. Once you know where the problems are
					we'll go through numerous options to improve the performance using
					indexes.

				<h1>The Cutting Edge</h1>
				<p>G'Day Developers!</p>

				<strong>Do you know when to use Reporting Services?</strong>
				<p>
					Like any solution, Reporting Services has its pros and cons. From
					our experience, we have discovered these things about Reporting
					Services:
				</p>
				<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Parameters - you are forced to use built-in controls</li>
					<li>
						Query string - when you change the parameters and refresh a
						report, the values do not appear directly in the query string,
						making it hard to copy/paste URLs
					</li>
					<li>
						Can't separate SQL into a strongly-typed dataset or middle-tier
						object like in ASP.NET
					</li>
					<li>
						There are potential difficulties with the deployment of RS reports
						and the exposing of them. However, once we have the
						infrastructure...
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						You can develop <strong>read only</strong> reports faster in
						Reporting Services than ASP.NET
					</li>
					<li>
						Maintenance with RS is easier as in most cases you don't have to
						write any code
					</li>
					<li>
						Flexibility with groupings and totals is easier ?in ASP.NET you
						would need to iterate through the DataSet keeping variables with
						the totals
					</li>
					<li>Parameters are built-in ?in ASP.NET there is code</li>
					<li>
						Drilldown interactivity ?in ASP.NET you need to code up a treeview
					</li>
					<li>
						Users can have reports emailed to them automatically on a schedule
					</li>
					<li>
						Users can export natively to PDF and XLS, plus a variety of other
						popular formats
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					So in conclusion, if you will only ever need 1 report, go with
					ASP.NET - it is easier to get up and running. If you plan to have
					more than one report, use Reporting Services - it's worth the time
					to set-up.
				</p>

					<strong>Software as a Service - Catching the Long Tail</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong></strong>The guest speaker Nigel Watson from Microsoft
					Australia will be talking about how from small start-ups to large
					enteprises, software as a service (SaaS) is changing how software is
					designed, developed and consumed. This session discusses the
					business drivers behind SaaS, and then looks at how these in turn
					drive the architecture of SaaS solutions as opposed to 'on-premise'
					software.
				</p>
				<p>
					Along the way, he will discuss the technical issues that any current
					or prospective SaaS vendor will need to grapple with in order to
					successfully deliver software as a service.
				</p>

					<strong>Atlas</strong>

						Tim Kremer</a>
					will continue to discuss the Microsoft Ajax Library from last
					month's session and will further reinforce its benefits and features
					such as:
				</p>
				<p>
					- Ability to integrate cross-browser client script libraries with
					the ASP.NET 2.0 server-based development framework.<br />
					<br />
					- Atlas' ability to take advantage of AJAX techniques on the web,
					thus enabling you to create ASP.NET pages with a rich, responsive UI
					and server communication.<br />
					<br />
					- Due to Atlas' extension of ASP.NET, it is fully integrated with
					server-based services.
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout his presentation Tim will take a one step further by
					providing you with worked examples of the new client libraries as
					well as using the server side libraries to add ajax functionality to
					your ASP.NET existing applications.
