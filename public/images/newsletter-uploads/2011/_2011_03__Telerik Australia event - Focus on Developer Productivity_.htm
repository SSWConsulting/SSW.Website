                            <strong>The Agile Buffet Table: Implementing your own Agile Process with Microsoft ALM Tools
                                - 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM </strong>
                            <p>
                                New to Agile? Having challenges implementing an agile process in your organization? Have
                                you been using Scrum,
                                but need to bend the rules to make it work in your organization? Can’t get the business
                                to “buy-in”? Come and
                                learn about implementing an agile process in your organization. You'll look at the
                                “buffet table” of agile
                                processes and procedures and learn how to properly decide “what to eat.” We’ll start by
                                defining XP, Scrum,
                                Kanban and some other popular methodologies and then learn how to mix and match each
                                process for various scenarios,
                                including the enterprise, ISVs, consulting, and remote teams. Then take a look at agile
                                tools and how they will
                                aid in implementing your development process. You’ll see how Microsoft Team Foundation
                                Server 2010 provides
                                process templates for Agile that facilitate better planning and metrics. Learn how
                                Microsoft’s application
                                lifecycle management (ALM) tools can support your development process. Lastly, we will
                                talk about how to “sell”
                                agile to your business partners and customers. The speakers have a very interactive
                                style so participation is
                                encouraged and there will be plenty of time for Q&A.

                            <p>
                                As more product teams move to Agile methodologies, the need for automated testing
                                becomes essential to generate
                                the velocity needed to ship fully tested features in short iterations. In this session
                                we will look at the
                                differences between traditional testing and agile testing, explore some tools and
                                strategies that can help make
                                your automation more productive as well as how to get the automation effort started for
                                both new and existing
                                agile projects.

                            <p>
                                Choosing a CMS can be a daunting task. There are plenty of Content Management Systems to
                                choose from; ranging in
                                price from free to extremely expensive. From this crowded landscape it can be difficult
                                to find a CMS that
                                effectively enables an organization to accomplish their goals. In this session, I will
                                identify 20 things to
                                consider when evaluating a CMS that will help you select the ideal CMS for your project.

                                developing applications with high performance and functionality, while output

                                applications with the Telerik tools. See how high-performance data controls like
                                RadGridView and RadChart can take
                                your applications to the next level. See how layout controls like RadDocking and
                                RadTileView can add both richness
                                and increased functionality, helping you maximize screen real estate. And see how
                                RadRichTextBox is unlocking

                                Telerik is the #1 .net vendor used by millions of people.

                                Ever wonder what goes into a startup project at Telerik? Ever wonder how technical and
                                functional decisions
                                are made? Want to see how Telerik TeamPulse is being built? For the technology used,
                                design patterns employed,
                                challenges faced, as well as team practices? In this session, Joel Semeniuk, Executive

                                The hardest aspects of an Agile project are getting started and knowing when you’re
                                done. Where do requirements
                                come from and what should they look like? How do you make sure that your project aligns
                                to its original intent?
                                How to you use Agile estimation and planning to go from an idea into a plan? How can you
                                help ensure your team
                                is following best practices as well as track progress? How can you ensure the ongoing
                                quality of your software,
                                even as it rapidly evolves.

                                increasing team efficiency and focus.

                                Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft
                                .NET platform. These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful
                                projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software
                                development process.

                            <p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your
                                company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session
                                because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word
                                processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have
                                on the entire business process.</p>

                                code analysis tool that allows developers to take control of your code, ensuring
                                large, complex source code can be simplified, cleaned and maintained. The built-in
                                rules focus on the most popular .NET languages (C#, VB.NET) for both Windows Forms
                                and ASP.NET; however, the flexibility of SSW Code Auditor allows the developer to
                                add their own rules to target any language in any text file.</p>
