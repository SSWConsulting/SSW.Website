                            <p>It has been an amazing, intense 9 weeks, and while I’m sad that it is over, I couldn't be
                                more proud of the guys and what they've achieved. They've all improved in different
                                ways:</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Some were juniors straight out of uni… they’re still juniors but now with great
                                    experience. They surely know the right way to do things. These guys could spot a
                                    smell if you wanted to architect a dodgy solution that was untestable.</li>
                                <li>Some are recently arrived from India with many years of experience but big gaps…
                                    they now leave with much improved communication skills, giving clear explanations in
                                    Sprint Reviews. They are now able to manage a Product Owner much better. They even
                                    shake the PO's hand with confidence!</li>
                            </ul>

                                stuck it out as the Product Owner turned up the heat, while always changing his

                            <h3>Why we created FireBootCamp</h3>

                            <p>We didn’t jump into running a boot camp like this lightly. There was a few problems that
                                kept arising at SSW:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Corporate training – lots people were taking our training – we still do it for large
                                    corporates around the country and it costs them a lot of money. We love teaching the
                                    newest technologies and methods along with our best practices, but when we followed
                                    up with them later they were not using what we had taught them to its fullest – they
                                    would tell it was “still on the backlog”… basically they were seeing but not doing.
                                </li>
                                <li>UTS lectures – A number of the SSW guys lecture at the University of Technology. We
                                    were seeing people going through a 10 week course but the theoretical knowledge
                                    gained was not transferring into results. They needed practical experience beyond
                                    simple exercises.</li>
                                <li>Work Experience – SSW often get juniors who are happy to work with us for 3 months
                                    or more for free, but when they are blocked we don’t really have a great reason to
                                    pull off one of our consultants (that is working for our clients) to help them out,
                                    so the work experience guy might stay stuck for days or weeks.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>This is why we started FireBootCamp, to integrate the theory with the practice in an
                                environment where experienced consultants could support the learners through the process
                                by:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Doing the theory in the morning</li>
                                <li>Then practicing the real project in the afternoon</li>
                                <li>Learning Scrum and ALM along the way</li>
                                <li>All while making "Bob" (the Product Owner) happy</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The course is not a panacea, and not everyone will graduate a guaranteed expert – but
                                every attendee is definitely many steps above where they were before starting. Plus they
                                are more confident and competent, with a solid skill-set that they can build on:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Know the right way to attack problems</li>
                                <li>Work with people very different from themselves</li>
                                <li>Worked in cross functional teams</li>
                                <li>All while providing incremental deliveries of real business value in every sprint to
                                    "Bob" (the Product Owner)</li>
                            </ul>

                    engineering practices - to develop
                    an increment of potentially releasable functionality using a specific technology platform.

                    Classes are exercise-driven, with students working in self-organizing teams to develop "done"

                    This 3-day Professional Scrum Developer .NET course is a mix of lecture, demonstration, group
                    discussion, simulation, and hands-on
                    software development. The bulk of the course will be spent working as a team on a case study
                    application delivering increments of new
                    functionality in mini-sprints. Here is the course at a glance:

                        Farnhill</strong></p>

                <p>
                    In this session Brian Farnhill (Premier Field Engineer with Microsoft) will talk you through the new
                    app models for Office and SharePoint 2013, and why they matter
                    to a wider audience of developers now more than ever. He will highlight what has been problematic in
                    developing for Office and SharePoint in previous releases, and
                    highlight why the new model addresses these issues, and opens the platform up for the use of modern
                    web technologies. This session is a must see for anyone who is
                    interested in developing for Office, SharePoint or Office365, as well as anyone who has ever talked
                    trash about developing for SharePoint...
