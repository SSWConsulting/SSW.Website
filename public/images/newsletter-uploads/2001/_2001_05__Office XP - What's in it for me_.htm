									the most of your day by starting off with an SSW Tech Breakfast.
									The SSW Tech Breakfast is a great way to get to know what is good
									and bad about the latest technologies. You take away real knowledge

									is on Tuesday May 15 on <b>SharePoint Portal Server</b>. <a

							<p><span class="updatetext"><b>SSW Eats It's Own Dog Food Yet Again!<br>
									</b>SSW has installed SharePoint Portal Server as a replacement
									for it's intranet and has built solutions using this technology
									for a number of it's clients. Portal Server definitely needs a well
									spec'd machine; Microsoft recommend a dual processor! but the reports
									from the guys in the office are that it's very usable on a single
									proc with 512MB of RAM. It is a great way of finding information,
									and there were whoops of delight every time we created new web parts
									for it!</span></p>
							<p><span class="updatetext"><b>50 Days to Register!<br>
									</b>Do you have illegal software on your network? Can you be certain
									you have a license? If you are running illegal software you run
									the risk of heavy fines. However, there is a solution! The BSAA
									(Business Software Association of Australia) is currently in the
									middle of a 60 day truce, recognised by Microsoft, Adobe, Macromedia
									and other software providers, which will allow you to register your
									illegal software with no threat of litigation. </span></p>
							<p><span class="updatetext">In
									the old days you might have got away with being slack. This days

							<p><span class="updatetext">As
									a few of you may know I was recently appointed an <a href="/ssw/Redirect/SSWUpdate/0105MSDNRD.htm"
										target="_blank">MS
										Regional Director.</a> I am happy to report that this position comes
									with some perks, so I was flown to Redmond this month for some .NET
									training and there's a few points of interest and concerns which
									I'd like to share.</span></p>
							<p><span class="updatetext">BTW
									- Microsoft headquarters is not one massive office block as I had
									expected, but a whole bunch of buildings, much like a University
									campus. It is huge, it is like every campus in Australia joined
									together! All the walking involved must be Bill's way of keeping
									the geeks fit.<br>
								</span></p>
							<p><span class="updatetext">Anyway,
									everyone over there is going crazy about browser-based solutions.
									Browser Based Solutions are great, but everyone seems to be over-exaggerating
									the demise of &quot;rich&quot; windows clients. I feel too much
									emphasis is being placed on browser-based clients.<br>
									<br>
									Windows-based clients are richer and <b>Power Users </b>know it.
									Even a regular User often feels something is missing. I recently
									gave a user their new web based application - which replaced their
									old and cranky Access app. All Mary does is find and enter data,
									but she said &quot;it feels like I have taken a step backwards:
									it's a little slower, the right-click menus have gone and I have
									to use the mouse more often.&quot;</span></p>
							<p><span class="updatetext">Web
									Services are very important feature of .NET, but are developers
									being made aware that they can take advantage of them in Windows
									clients? I haven't heard a speaker from Microsoft talk about it.
									Did You know Napster (one of the most popular, recent Web-based
									technologies) is built around a Windows client, not a browser. The
									Windows clients is taking advantage of a kind of Web Service. Now
									I know that they are being screwed in the legal system and the service
									is all but useless, but if they ever release a new version, I expect
									it would be based on VB.Net and Web Services. </span></p>
							<p><span class="updatetext">So
									Access/VB/Winforms are cool because of their richness. So when we
									are developing a browser based front end we keep this in mind. Here
									are a few ways you can also make your web based forms richer:</span></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="updatetext">Use
										Drag and Drop (you'll need a control)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="updatetext">
										Use Drop down menus</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="updatetext">
										Use Toolbars</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="updatetext">
										Use Right click menus (you'll need a control)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="updatetext">
										Use Double Clicks (why do developers seem to forget about them
										when developing web pages)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="updatetext">
										Use Default Buttons (good luck)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="updatetext">If
										it is an intranet make sure you can design for IE5 and higher.
										In today's world there really is only one browser to worry about.
										It is not worth designing for that other browser...what is it
										called? Opera (BTW that is a joke, I don't want Netscape hate
										mail). </span>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p><span class="updatetext">Get
									your developers using Outlook Web Access - part of Exchange 2000
									- it is richest based web interface I have seen to date, and a great
									way for you to see what is possible.</span></p>
							<p><span class="updatetext">In
									the meantime, don't get led astray by the fanfare of browser-based
									development. Choose the client that makes the most sense for your
									users. If none of your users are mobile currently, you should still
									architect your applications to allow for new UI layers in the future
									(whether they be Windows CE, .NET compact framework, HTML, DHTML,
									WAP, or whatever-based). Continue to look at and learn about .NET
									technologies as it is what you will be using in the very near future.
								</span></p>
							<p><span class="updatetext">And
									also, a plea to Bill - my legs are killing me, invest in some golf
									buggies for getting around your small town, know by all Microsofties
									as 'Corp'!</span></p>
							<p><span class="updatetext">Cheers
									until next time, <br>
