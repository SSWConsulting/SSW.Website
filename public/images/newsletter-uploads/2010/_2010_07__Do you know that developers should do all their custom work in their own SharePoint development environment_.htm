                            <p>G'Day Developers!</p>

                            <p>
                                This is to prevent their work affecting other developers. During development, you can
                                expect many of these things to happen:
                            </p>
                            <ul type="circle">
                                <li>IIS resets may need to be done frequently, which stops the SharePoint website
                                    working. </li>
                                <li>Custom webparts can easily introduce memory leaks which can stop SharePoint working.
                                </li>
                                <li>You may be running development SharePoint in debugging mode which would hold the
                                    server thread. </li>
                                <li>You may be reading event or error logs that are being polluted by other developers
                                    simultaneously. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Thus, all SharePoint customization and development must be done on a Virtual Machine. No
                                ifs, no buts.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>It's very important to correctly setup a SharePoint environment for development.
                                    Correctly configured, this will save you a lot of trouble later on. </li>
                                <li>From time to time, you can seriously screw/damage a SharePoint installation during
                                    development and it is best not to install SharePoint on your day-to-day machine.
                                </li>
                                <li>Additionally, when you start a new SharePoint project you don't want to carry all
                                    the baggage from previous customizations that could potentially affect your new
                                    project. </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>There are many other benefits of using a virtual machine for development</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Virtual machines can be fired up and shut down easily </li>
                                <li>Virtual machines can run faster, via being located on a different server and thus it
                                    doesn't waste developers' own computer resources </li>
                                <li>Virtual machines can be copied and brought to a client for demonstration or testing
                                </li>
                                <li>They are the best way to quickly test or experiment with something new </li>
                                <li>Virtual machines can frees up resources on the host, so it doesn&#8217;t waste
                                    resource when developers are not working on SharePoint </li>
                                <li>Virtual machines can be easily cloned to scale up the development team </li>
                                <li>Virtual machines enable developers to work in Windows Server 2003 / 2008 environment
                                    so they will be aware of the configuration issue when deploying to staging and
                                    production </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>There are few consideration when using Virtual Machines:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Need to activate additional servers </li>
                                <li>Need at least 2 GB of RAM for SharePoint 2007 </li>
                                <li>Need at least 4 GB of RAM for SharePoint 2010</li>
                                <li>Virtual PC does not support 64 bit Operating Systems</li>
                                <li>If you&#8217;re using Windows 7 or Vista, we recommend using &#8216;boot to
                                    VHD&#8217; or VMWare </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                If you are after a clean, pre-configured SharePoint server image to test SharePoint, the

                                We all use Visual Studio to code all day but do you really get the most out of the IDE?
                                In this session,
                                Justin will show over 50 tips/tricks in Visual Studio 2010 to speed up your development
                                process. Justin
                                will also demonstrate Devexpress Code Rush and show you how to take your development to
                                the next level,
                                both in speed but also productivity on repetitive tasks.

                                One of the fundamental things a developer does is to solve problems. Learning the
                                toolset to be an
                                efficient debugger and learning how to quickly identify bugs and potential problems. In
                                this session,
                                Justin will show the new debugging features in Visual Studio 2010 and cover items such
                                as Watchlists, Breakpoints,
                                Locals, WinDbg and working with Dump files, attaching to Processes and using Symbols to
                                look into the .NET
                                source code. If time permits, we will take a look at profiling an application to
                                identify performance issues
                                with ANTS Profiler.

                            <p><strong>Unity Injection for ASP.Net and WCF</strong> by <a
                                    href="https://www.neovolve.com/">Rory Primrose</a></p>
                            <p>
                                Unity is the Microsoft Patterns and Practises implementation of an inversion of control
                                (IoC) container.
                                Using IoC containers facilitates the dependency injection pattern which helps to
                                decouple code from its
                                dependencies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A common way to implement IoC in ASP.Net and WCF services is to couple the hosted
                                application to the IoC
                                container. The first half of this session will look at how ASP.Net and WCF applications
                                can be extended
                                to leverage the benefits of IoC while decoupling the hosted application from the
                                container.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second half of the session will look at how Unity can be extended to provide a
                                recursive disposal
                                pattern for build trees created by the container.

                                Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress. Visual Studio
                                Ultimate is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by
                                project managers. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help
                                teams improve their software development activities and to help project managers
                                better support the software development processes.</p>

                                SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The SharePoint Team has invested in

                                and the other knowledge workers.</p>
                            <p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your
                                business. Then see real world examples of:</p>

                                    (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by </li>
                                <li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to
                                    improve visibility/searchability/versioning across the company </li>
                                <li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (eg using Access and
                                    Excel) </li>
                                <li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means </li>
                                <li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint </li>

                                <li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (eg VSTS
                                    integration with Outlook) </li>
                                <li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>

                            <p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your
                                company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session
                                because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word
                                processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have
                                on the entire business process.</p>

                            <p>Are you looking to eradicate bugs and ensure consistency? SSW Code Auditor is a
                                code analysis tool that allows developers to take control of your code, ensuring
                                large, complex source code can be simplified, cleaned and maintained. The built-in
                                rules focus on the most popular .NET languages (C#, VB.NET) for both Windows Forms
                                and ASP.NET; however, the flexibility of SSW Code Auditor allows the developer to
                                add their own rules to target any language in any text file.</p>

                                This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your
                                company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session
                                because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word
                                processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have
                                on the entire business process.</p>
