                            <p>
                                In SharePoint 2010, there are quite a few tools that we can use to take SharePoint data
                                offline. Let’s look at our options:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>use Outlook to synchronize document libraries, calendar and contacts offline</li>
                                <li>use Excel to take read-only copies of list data offline</li>
                                <li> use Access to take list data offline – Access also lets you edit offline and
                                    synchronize back</li>
                                <li> use SharePoint Workspace (this was Groove) to take entire Site offline,
                                    unfortunately this doesn’t work for calendars</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We think the best way is to use Workspaces instead of Outlook: </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    SharePoint Workspace synchronize an entire site
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>So when lists are renamed it knows about it</li>
                                        <li>It also knows about new lists that are added to a SharePoint site</li>
                                    </ul><br />

                                    <strong>Figure: SharePoint Workspace synchronizing an entire site </strong>
                                </li><br />
                                <li>Outlook can be quite busy when synchronizing to Exchange server; it is good to not
                                    burden it with more work</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>While SharePoint Workspace is quite good, we don’t like to store lists in it:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Access has better filtering, sorting options when offline</li>
                            </ol>

                                We will walk down the alley while learning:

                            <p>In conclusion, we will spend some time looking at the advantages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Live Writer is simple to use</li>
                                <li>Can download the styles from your SharePoint blog site so you can preview you blog
                                    post within Live Writer</li>
                                <li>The new Beta version 2011</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>And also the disadvantages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Can only publish to SharePoint Blog Sites not Wiki Page libraries</li>
                                <li>Getting around the limitation where Microsoft does not allow Live Writer to directly
                                    publish to a Wiki</li>
                            </ul>

                                In this session Adam will do a case study of putting up a KB/FAQ site on a SharePoint

                                We will walk down the alley while learning:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Live Writer and publishing to SharePoint Blog Site</li>
                                <li>Word 2010 and publishing to SharePoint Blog Site</li>
                                <li>Live Writer to Create Wiki pages in SharePoint via Blog Post</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>In conclusion, we will spend some time looking at the advantages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Live Writer is simple to use</li>
                                <li>Can download the styles from your SharePoint blog site so you can preview you blog
                                    post within Live Writer</li>
                                <li>The new Beta version 2011</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>And also the disadvantages:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Can only publish to SharePoint Blog Sites not Wiki Page libraries</li>
                                <li>Getting around the limitation where Microsoft does not allow Live Writer to directly
                                    publish to a Wiki</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>And we will declare the winner!</p>

                                Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft
                                .NET platform. These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful
                                projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software

                                Ultimate is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by
                                project managers. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help
                                teams improve their software development activities and to help project managers
                                better support the software development processes.</p>

                                platform to build the mission-critical applications that businesses depend on.
                                It extends Visual Studio's integrated and productive experience from the
                                developer to the entire development team by delivering powerful new role-based
                                tools for software architects, developers, testers and project managers. In this
                                session you will see an overview of these tools and how they can improve your
                                software development cycle. </p>

                                code better, your job easier, and your team more productive by reducing the
                                obstacles you face in your everyday coding life. Learn:</p>

                                    (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by </li>
                                <li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to
                                    improve visibility/searchability/versioning across the company </li>
                                <li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (eg using Access and

                                <li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means </li>
                                <li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint </li>

                                <li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (eg VSTS
                                    integration with Outlook) </li>

                            <p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your
                                company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session
                                because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word
                                processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have
                                on the entire business process.</p>

                            <p>Are you looking to eradicate bugs and ensure consistency? SSW Code Auditor is a
                                code analysis tool that allows developers to take control of your code, ensuring
                                large, complex source code can be simplified, cleaned and maintained. The built-in
                                rules focus on the most popular .NET languages (C#, VB.NET) for both Windows Forms
                                and ASP.NET; however, the flexibility of SSW Code Auditor allows the developer to
                                add their own rules to target any language in any text file.</p>

                                This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your
                                company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session
                                because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word
                                processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have
                                on the entire business process.</p>
