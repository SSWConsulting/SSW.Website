								<strong>Introducing the .NET Service Bus by Juval Lowy</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								The .NET services bus is part of the new Microsoft Cloud
								Computing Windows Azure initiative and, arguably, it is the
								most accessible, ready to use, powerful, and needed piece. The
								service bus allows clients to connects to services across any
								machine, network, firewall, NAT, routers, load balancers,
								virtualization, IP and DNS as if they were part of the same
								local network, and doing all that without compromising on the
								programming model or security. The service bus also supports
								callbacks, event publishing, authentication and authorization
								and doing all that in a WCF-friendly manner. This session will
								present the service bus programming model, how to configure
								and administer service bus solutions, working with the
								dedicated relay bindings including the available communication
								modes, relying on authentication in the cloud for local
								services and the various authentication options, and how to
								provide for end-to-end security through the relay service. You
								will also see some advanced WCF programming techniques,
								original helper classes, productivity-enhancing utilities and
								tools, as well as discussion of design best practices and
								pitfalls.
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>Discover a new WCF with Discovery by Juval Lowy</strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								Up until WCF 4.0, the service address had to be known in
								advance to the client. This complicated deployment and run
								time configuration. In addition, the service had no way of
								knowing that its port or pipe is available for use in the
								first place. With WCF 4.0, you can use service address
								discovery to address both issues. The client can discover at
								run time the service address, and the service can pick up any
								available address on the fly. WCF also offers announcements of
								the service when its goes on or off line, and scoping of the
								discovered services. Moreover, it turns out that discovery
								opens the door for new ways of composing applications and new
								design patterns for distributing information in the system.
								This session starts by discussing the basic support of
								discovery in WCF and then presents helper classes that
								streamline the interaction with discovery both on the client
								and the service side and the related design patterns,
								including a framework for a discovery-based publish-subscribe
								system.

								<strong>Team Foundation Server 2010 for Successful Project
									Management</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System
								(VSTS)) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones
								of development on the Microsoft .NET platform. These are the
								best tools for a project manager to have successful projects
								and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software
								development process.
							</p>
							<p>
								Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS
								Champ and Chief Architect from SSW show you:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									How to successfully gather requirements with User stories
								</li>
								<li>The right way to use work items</li>
								<li>The way to complete a work items and send a 'done'</li>
								<li>How to use templates for your standard work items</li>
								<li>The extra work items that developers always forget</li>
								<li>
									What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration
								</li>
								<li>
									What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the
									Project portals available from the SharePoint dashboard
								</li>
								<li>The important reports to give your Project Manager</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Walk away knowing how to see your project health and progress.
								Visual Studio Ultimate is designed to help address many of
								these traditional problems faced by project managers. It does
								so by providing a set of integrated tools to help teams
								improve their software development activities and to help
								project managers better support the software development
								processes.
							</p>
							<p>
								During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating
								work items and tracking of releases using Visual Studio
								Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.
							</p>

							<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Team System - An Overview </strong>
							<p>
								Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team System is an integrated
								software development platform to build the mission-critical
								applications that businesses depend on. It extends Visual
								Studio's integrated and productive experience from the
								developer to the entire development team by delivering
								powerful new role-based tools for software architects,
								developers, testers and project managers. In this session you
								will see an overview of these tools and how they can improve
								your software development cycle.
							</p>

							<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Testing with Team Foundation Server (TFS)
								2010 - the life of a bug
							</strong>
							<p>
								Visual Studio 2010 makes up a large part of a .Net developers
								life. This session will delve into the 'life of a bug' by
								taking a walk in the shoes of an everyday bug from discovery
								to release (and the steps that make up the in between). Come
								along and check out the new features that will make you
								happier by making your code better, your job easier, and your
								team more productive by reducing the obstacles you face in
								your everyday coding life. Learn:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>What the new features are for testers and developers</li>
								<li>
									How you now care - even if the tester can't reproduce the
									bug
								</li>
								<li>
									How to stop struggling to find the source of the bug in your
									code
								</li>
								<li>
									How can you streamline the testing process and make sure you
									don't repeat the same bugs
								</li>
								<li>
									How to automate more and reproduce bugs easier and discover
									problems sooner.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<strong>What's new in SharePoint 2010</strong>
							<p>
								In this session Adam Cogan will provide information about what
								is new in SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The
								SharePoint Team has invested in many including:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>UX support for Silverlight and Ajax</li>
								<li>Their Web Content Management System</li>
								<li>Digital Asset Management System (for videos)</li>
								<li>Visual Studio 2010 tools for SharePoint 2010</li>
								<li>Developer Platform</li>
								<li>Office 2010 integration</li>
								<li>RESTful Web API</li>
								<li>Tagging and Rating</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Lets see what's good and what's not.</p>

							<strong>Something About Mary (SharePoint 2010 and Office
								2010)</strong>
							<p>
								Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint
								and Office for Mary and the other knowledge workers.
							</p>
							<p>
								First you will get an overview of what is great about having
								SharePoint in your business. Then see real world examples of:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together</li>
								<li>
									Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like
									CRM 4 and TFS
								</li>
								<li>
									Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into
									business processes (separate from SharePoint)
								</li>
								<li>
									Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with
									SharePoint to improve visibility/searchability/versioning
									across the company
								</li>
								<li>
									Overview of how data can be synchronized between SharePoint
									and external data sources (eg using Access and Excel)
								</li>
								<li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means</li>
								<li>
									How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with
									SharePoint
								</li>
								<li>
									Extending SharePoint with Office SharePoint Designer 2010
									(free!)
								</li>
								<li>
									Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be
									developed
								</li>
								<li>
									Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations
									(eg the the Atlassian SharePoint Connector and Atlassian
									Office Connector)
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using
								Office in your company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam
								gets excited about this session because too often companies
								limit Office to just an email application, word processor and
								spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can
								have on the entire business process.
