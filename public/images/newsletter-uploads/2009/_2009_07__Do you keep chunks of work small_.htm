							<p>G'Day Developers!</p>

							<p>
								Frequently developers work on long or difficult features/bugs
								and leave code checked out for days or worse still weeks.
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>What happens if your laptop hard drive dies?</li>
								<li>What happens if you call in sick?</li>
								<li>
									How can you pair program if not sharing your changesets?
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								That's why source code should be checked in regularly. We
								recommend a check-in:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>
									Immediately after completing a piece of functionality, where
									the
									<a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterSourceControl.aspx#CompilePassed">
										code compiles and passes the unit tests</a>
								</li>
								<li>Before lunch or dinner</li>
								<li>
									Before leaving your workstation for an extended period of
									time
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>
								If the changes would break the build or are in a state that
								cannot be put into the main trunk, then this code should be
								put into a
								<a href="/SSW/Redirect/MSDN2/Shelveset.htm"> shelveset</a>
								(sometimes referred to as 'sandbox') in source control.
							</p>

							<p>
								Another good reason to check-in regularly is that it makes it
								easier to merge your changes with other developers. If all
								developers check-in lots of changes in one go, you will spend
								a lot of your time resolving conflicts instead of doing work.
							</p>

							<p>
								TIP: How can you enforce regular check-ins? Monitor them using
								a
								<a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterSourceControl.aspx#CheckinReport">
									report to see who has not checked in</a>.
							</p>

							<p>
								See more of the
								<a href="/ssw/Standards/Rules/"> SSW Rules</a> pages.

								<strong>Eliminating No-repro Bugs &#8211; A look at the new
									Microsoft Visual Studio� Team Test 2010 product. by
									<a href="https://www.myvstsblog.com">Anthony Borton</a></strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								The July Sydney .NET User group meeting looks at the recently
								released Microsoft Visual Studio� Team Test 2010 Beta 1
								product and how it can drastically reduce the &#8220;find and
								fix&#8221; time for bugs that are raised by your testers.
								Today, significant time is often wasted trying to reproduce
								bugs with limited success and labelling bugs as
								&#8220;No-repro&#8221; can be frustrating for both testers and
								developers.
							</p>

							<p>
								Microsoft&#8217;s new Test and Lab Manager Application allows
								testers to create, manage and execute tests quickly and easily
								in a dedicated user interface. Using Test Cases, Test Suites
								and Test Plans, testers will find the new features allow them
								to better participate as a full team member in Visual Studio
								Team System.
							</p>

							<p>
								The session will touch on the following features of the Visual
								Studio Team Test 2010 product.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Microsoft Test Runner</li>
								<li>Microsoft Test and Lab Manager application</li>
								<li>Bug Reporting and Data Collectors</li>
								<li>Unit Testing</li>
								<li>Coded UI Test</li>
								<li>Web Test</li>
								<li>Load Test</li>
							</ul>

								<strong>What Just Happened to Silverlight & Expression! by

										Scott Barnes</a></strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Silverlight & Expression 3 launch is an important moment in
								Microsoft's timeline, as this is our V3 moment!. In light of
								this point in time, Scott has vowed to ensure all within his
								beloved home, Australia, get a deep insight into what just
								happened in both Silverlight and Expression 3. Not only will
								Scott cover off some of the new stuff, but will highlight some
								of the existing brilliance within these products through
								examples and commentary of how the old and new features came
								to be (as well as hints to both product's future).
							</p>

							<p>
								In this session you not only will hear all of this, but this
								is also a perfect opportunity to lobby for what you want to
								see in Silverlight & Expression 4! - Yes, not only did we just
								finish work on 3, but we're keen to get started on the next
								version - given Scott's team is on the planning team, this is
								a great opportunity for you to influence the future of
								Microsoft's UX Platform
							</p>

							<p><b>About the Presenter</b></p>
							<p>
								Scott is a Rich Platforms Product Manager for the UX Platform
								Team (Silverlight, WPF, Expression, ASP.NET etc).
							</p>
							<p>
								He has been working with Microsoft/Adobe/Macromedia technology
								for the past 10 years with a main focus specifically on
								Internet Applications (aka. RIA, Rich Client Technology etc).
								<br />
								Scott first started out as a UX developer in the late
								90&#8217;s and over the years developed a passion for
								programmatic art (Designer + Developer mind). He recently has
								branched out further into 3D modelling, animation and XNA game
								development making full use of both his designer + developer
								mindset.
