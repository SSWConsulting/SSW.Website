							<h1>[<span class="magazineTitle"> the cutting edge</span> ]</h1>
							<p>G'Day Developers!</p>
							<p>
								Its important that you have a consistent code comment standard
								throughout an application, regardless of language. Therefore,
								other developers can quickly determine the workings of a
								function/sub/class/stored procedure. Ideally, code should be
								as simple and self-explanatory as possible. Exceptions should
								be noted in line, especially when there is a .NET catch
								statement for generic System.Exceptions (in VB6/Access - for a
								Resume Next statement or similar).
							</p>
							<p>
								e.g. catch (InteropServices.COMException ex)
								<span class="Caption">//Catch all COM Exceptions from third party COM
									component</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								In JavaScript and HTML, you should put these comments between
								the
								<br />
								&lt;HEAD&gt; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/HEAD&gt;<br />
								tags.&nbsp;<br />
								<br />
								To delmit the comments (ie top and bottom), you should use the
								standard block comment markers of
								<br />
								&lt;!--&nbsp;and --&gt;.
								<br />
								<br />
								A css file should be delimited with the block comment marks of
								<br />
								/* and */.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the file contains any function/sub module/class
								declaration, comments will be containted to each of them
								containing at least the following:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>function/sub module/class name</li>
								<li>role of the function/sub module/class declaration</li>
							</ul>
							<blockquote>
								<div style="
											border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);
											padding: 15px 10px;
											background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);
										">
									<p>
										<b><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: courier new">Above a method or property
												declaration:<br /> </span></b><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: courier new">'''
											&lt;summary&gt;<br />
											'''
											<br />
											''' &lt;/summary&gt;<br />
											''' &lt;param&nbsp;name="sender"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br />
											''' &lt;param&nbsp;name="e"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br />
											''' &lt;remarks&nbsp;&gt;&lt;/remarks&gt;<br />
										</span>
									</p>
									The comments can be generated automatically by VS.NET<br />
									/// - C#<br />
									''' - VB.NET<br />
									Bonus - you can automatically generate documentation - but
									the number of clients that want this is minimal.
