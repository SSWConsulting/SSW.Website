			1. THE ACCESS/ASP/SQL SERVER USER GROUP <br/>
			===================================================
		</p>
<p>
			The MARCH "Microsoft Access/ASP/SQL Server User Group, Sydney"
			is scheduled for Wednesday 15th February 2000, 5:45 pm
		</p>
<p>
			1) We are having a discussion on what the GST means to us and our clients
			(as developers):
		</p>
<p>
			The ABN: Who’s eligible and what does it mean? <br/>
			The GST: Its impact on your business and your database. <br/>
			PAG vs PAYE:The new and the old. How will these changes affect you? <br/>
			BAS: The Business Activity Statement is to be lodged every three months
			and will have a running effect on your business.
		</p>
<p>
			2) What are those DTS Tools in SQL Server? <br/>
			Also Eris McEncroe will give a presentation on organising data for using
			Business Intelligence applications ( like ad hoc query, reporting and OLAP
			systems). Eris will cover the advantages of Star schema over Normalised
			database schema for this type of application. The presentation will
			include a demo showing how Data Transformation Services (DTS) can be used
			to restructure data into the required format. DTS, which ships with SQL
			Server 7, enables data to be extracted from just about any source,
			scrubbed,transformed and then pumped to a desired destination. Neither
			sources or targets needs to be a SQL server database. The whole process
			can be automated and scheduled to run as required.
		</p>
<p>
			Attending the user group is free and is an excellent opportunity to share
			ideas and pick up hot development tips.
		</p>
<p>
			SSW has been running the "Microsoft Access/ASP/SQL Server User Group,
			Sydney" since 1992. For more information and a map of how to get
			there see the web site at www.ssw.com.au/AccessUG

<p>
			=================================================== <br/>
			2. DEVCON 2000 - CONFERENCE FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPERS <br/>
			=================================================== <br/>
			If you are serious about developing and keeping ahead of the pack,
			consider attending DevCom2000.
		</p>
<p>Perth March 28 – 31 The Sheraton Hotel</p>
<p>Sydney April 2 – 5 The Manly Pacific Parkroyal</p>
<p>
			You will: <br/>
			* BE THE FIRST in Australia to know about SQL Server 2000 XML and HTTP
			Enhancements. These tools will be detailed so you will learn how to store
			and retrieve XML from SQL Server programmatically.
		</p>
<p>
			* Be given a tool to quickly analyse the slowest forms in your database
			then drill down and see the cause.
		</p>
<p>
			* SAVE WEEKS in your SQL Server conversion. Upsizing to SQL Server from
			Access 97 requires preparation of your back end and front end databases.
			We will show you what to look for, walk you through the code and then give
			you the code and preparation tool to TAKE AWAY
		</p>
<p>
			* TURN YOUR STORED PROCEDURES FROM A CHORE INTO A CINCH. Most people
			believe that Stored Procedures are difficult to code for and it DOESN'T
			HELP when Microsoft doesn't document real shortcuts - BUT WE'LL SHOW YOU
			HOW!
		</p>
<p>
			* MAXIMISE YOUR ADO PERFORMANCE. ADO is becoming the defacto standard for
			data access all over the world. ADO is being employed to handle complex
			client/server as well as middle tier and web based development chores.
			Learn how to get more out ActiveX.
		</p>
<p>
			* Learn how easy it is to integrate Outlook with your database forms, how
			to use VBA and COM add-ins,then put together an enterprise/office calendar
			solution - ALL THE CODE IS YOURS TO TAKE AND EXPAND into your
			applications.
		</p>
<p>
			The aim of DevCon 2000 is for you to come away from the conference with
			real benefits and value for money. We are confident that delegates will
			learn more in 4 days at DevCon than 4 months in the office!

			still lacking some items of furniture, it is definitely “Business As
			Usual.” Conducting team meetings on the floor of the boardroom makes
			the brain function a lot faster than usual; creativity has doubled!

<p>
			* Programmers with Access, VB, and ASP experience <br/>
			* SQL Server Gurus

			4. SSW UPSIZING PRO! VERSION 3.1 NOW AVAILABLE <br/>
			=================================================== <br/>
			Converting your database from Access to SQL Server? Use SSW Upsizing PRO!
			and save time.
		</p>
<p>
			SSW Upsizing PRO! checks your Microsoft Access 97/2000 database and help
			you get it ready for the Microsoft Access 'Upsizing Wizard'. Use it BEFORE
			you convert to SQL Server and you will save heaps of time. Use it AFTER
			and it will check if everything was OK and recommend changes for you to
			implement.
		</p>
<p>
			This HOT utility does the checking of your database that the 'Microsoft
			Upsizing Wizard' should have done. After you use the generated reports,
			you can upsize to SQL Server without any worries.

			that they have Internet Explorer 5. <br/>

		</p>
<p>
			&lt;% <br/>
			Dim br <br/>
			Set br = Server.CreateObject("MSWC.BrowserType") <br/>
			If CInt(br.majorver) &lt; 5 Then 'check browser version and notice that
			netscape also hasn't got version number greater than 5.
		</p>
<p>
			%&gt; <br/>
<br/>
			&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt; <br/>
			&lt;!-- <br/>
