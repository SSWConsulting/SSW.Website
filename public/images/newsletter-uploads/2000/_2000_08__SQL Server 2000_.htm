        ==========================================================================
      </p>
      <p>Data Renovator gets rave review in Technical Magazine Smart Access by
        Garry Robinson www.vb123.com </p>
      <p>What does he say? <br>
        "Into this minefield of complexity and valuable live data steps an Access
        utility called SSW Data Renovator. The program is designed to transfer
        information from an old database structure to a new database structure.
        It does this by analyzing both databases and working out what has changed
        between the old and the new... "I would recommend the product for a lot
        of transfer exercises as it will allow you to concentrate on the job of
        getting the newest database design correct... "Thinking back this program
        could have saved me about 30 hours in the last year and as the program
        is delivered to you fully operational for 50 trials, then you should have
        no trouble deciding if it OK for you..." visit https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/DataRenovator/

        3. Hot Tips for Developers<br>
        =========================================================================
      </p>
      <p>SQL Server <br>
        The SQL Server 7.0 "Currency" data type stores monetary information to
        four decimal places. This can get messy when calculating and storing values
        such as GST Amounts. To avoid repeatedly using "CAST" and "CONVERT" and
        "ROUND" in stored procedures, you should try using a user-defined datatype.
        A data type of decimal (19,2) should do the trick. 19 is the total length
        of the number ("precision"), and 2 is the number of decimal places ("scale")
        of the number. To make it even easier to use, create a new default of
        "(0)" and assign it to the datatype. Using data types and defaults in
        this way allows greater consistency between fields in the database. </p>

 </p>
      <p>VB/ Access Beginners Tip <br>
        Don't use If...ElseIf...ElseIf... when a Select Case is more appropriate
      </p>
      <p>Example of code in the OnCurrent Event </p>
      <p>If DateDiff("d", [LastPay], Date) <= 30 Then <br>
        Me.Detail.BackColor = vbWhite <br>
        ElseIf DateDiff("d", [LastPay], Date) < 60 Then <br>
        Me.Detail.BackColor = vbYellow ElseIf <br>
        DateDiff("d", [LastPay], Date) > 90 Then <br>
        Me.Detail.BackColor = vbRed <br>
        End If </p>
      <p>This code more efficient and more easily updated with this Select Case...
      </p>
      <p>lngDays = DateDiff("d", [LastPay], Date) <br>
        Select Case lngDays <br>
        Case <= 30<br>
        Me.Detail.BackColor = vbWhite <br>
        Case 31 to 59 <br>
        Me.Detail.BackColor = vbYellow <br>
        Case 60 to 89 <br>
        Me.Detail.BackColor = vbBlue <br>
        Case Else <br>
        Me.Detail.BackColor = vbRed<br>
        End Select </p>
