		<p>5. Hot Tips</p>
		<p>
			&middot; The StrConv Function <br />
			&middot; Simplifying Debugging
		</p>
		<p>
			<br />
			1) The StrConv Function<br />
			If you have problems with the formatting of sting data, the StrConv
			function can be useful. <br />
			For example, you may wish to convert a name of &quot;JOE BLOGGS&quot; to
			proper case i.e &quot;Joe Bloggs&quot;, or you may wish to convert from
			lower to upper case. <br />
			For example, to convert all data in a field to proper case, you could use:
		</p>
		<p>StrConv([User_Name],3)</p>
		<p>or to convert to upper case, you could use:</p>
		<p>StrConv([User_Name],1)</p>
		<p>
			Thanks to David Klein for this tip<br />
			<br />
			2) Use Resume 0 to simplify debugging.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you get an error, hit Ctrl-Break at the error msgbox and the code
			window appears with the msgbox command highlighted. Place the cursor on
			the Resume 0 and hit Ctrl-F9 (set next line) then Ctrl-F8 (step one line)
			and you are back at the line that caused the error. I automatically add
			&quot;Resume 0 'For debugging&quot; to the end of all error handlers for
			this purpose.
