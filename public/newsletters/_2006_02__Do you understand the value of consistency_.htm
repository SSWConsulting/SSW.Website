											<p>G'Day Developers!<b><br>
											<br>
											Do you understand the value of 
											consistency?</b><br>
											<br>
											If you need to do something more than once, then there should be a standard for it. At the heart of our philosophy on creating rules and standards is the idea of consistency.
											<p>By performing multiple tasks in a consistent way, you can expect to:<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Improve productivity - because there are fewer decisions to make, and you build on existing work.</b>
		<br>For example, adding a registration system to our software just involves adding the standard SSW Registration project to our solution and calling it. </li>
		<br><br>
		<li><b>Improve quality - because you are following best practices.</b><br>For example, we have a standard exception logging framework that we plug into our software. Any unhandled exceptions are sent back to SSW for examination.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li><b>Improve communications - because people know what to expect.</b>
		<br>For example, whenever we send an email about a bug, we include a screenshot of the screen in question. And we have a clear 
		<a target="_blank" href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouUnderstandTheValueOfConsistency.aspx">definition of what's a bug.</li>
		</a>
	<br><br>
		<li><b>Get straight to the meat of the customer's problem.</b><br>For example, our developers don't need to decide whether to implement baseforms or user controls. They already know because it's covered in  
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWindowsForms.aspx#UserControls">Rules to Better Windows Forms Applications.</a></li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>At SSW we create standards for all manner of processes: from coding practices to project proposals and how to lock the office up at night.
	From the developer's perspective, consistency means that we understand each other's code, and if we don't know something, a standard will often save us asking someone. No more 
	Chinese whispers, and less time wasted.
	From the customer's perspective, consistency leads to a reliable and repeatable experience. 
	<a target="_blank" href="http://rules.ssw.com.au/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouUnderstandTheValueOfConsistency.aspx">
											The following story illustrates 
											these values...</a></p>

										<blockquote>Managing a team of coders can be a 
										tricky experience, especially as most 
										coders like to do things their own way. 
										During this session we go through a list 
										of rules the help make the development 
										process as smooth as possible. These 
										rules govern the creation of 
										specifications and schedules, best 
										methods for testing and fixing bugs and 
										even the employees working conditions. 
										Then we will dive into how you can make 
										the most of Exchange Server in your 
										organisation.</blockquote>
