				 <p>Source control is your backup of your code, as well as your change history to track changes.</p>
                
                <p>With the source control (we use TFS), we can share project code and cooperate with other team members. 
                Using it allows us to track changes, compare code and even roll-back if required. Moreover, 
				and most importantly, it keeps our code 
                safe.</p>
				<p>However, the best use is the blame game. You don't just fix 
				code, you see who broke it, fix it, and then let them know.</p>

        <p>While software development has been around for a while, projects and managing them has been around 
	    for even longer, so why should development teams be interested in a project management methodology 
	    that has been discussed widely only over the last few years? How does it relate to other Agile 
	    methodologies and will Scrum help when your team needs to deliver world class software on time and 
	    budget?</p>
	    <p>Yes, and in this session you will be shown how Scrum works with:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The important concepts of Scrum and how it relates with other Agile techniques</li>
		<li>The features of Scrum to make it adaptable to your team, what types of projects it can be applied to and challenges that can arise</li>

		<li>Plus a couple of things that will maximize your productivity with Scrum in practice</li>

        <p>
        Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft .NET platform. 
        These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software development process.</p>

        <p>
        Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS Champ and Chief Architect from SSW show you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to successfully gather requirements with User stories </li>
                <li>The right way to use work items </li>
                <li>The way to complete a work items and send a 'done' </li>
                <li>Use templates for your standard work items </li>

                <li>The extra work items that developers always forget </li>
                <li>What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration </li>
                <li>What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the Project portals available on from the SharePoint dashboard </li>
                <li>The important reports to give your Project Manager </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress. Visual Studio Ultimate is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by project managers. 
        It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help teams improve their software development activities and to help project managers better support the software 
        development processes.</p>

        <p>
        During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and tracking of releases using Visual Studio Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.</p>

    <strong>Visual Studio 2010 Team System - An Overview </strong>
        <p>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team System is an integrated software development platform to build the mission-critical applications that businesses depend on. It extends 
        Visual Studio's integrated and productive experience from the developer to the entire development team by delivering powerful new role-based tools for software architects, 
        developers, testers and project managers. In this session you will see an overview of these tools and how they can improve your software development cycle. </p>
        
    <strong>Visual Studio 2010 Testing with Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2010 - the life of a bug </strong>
        <p>Visual Studio 2010 makes up a large part of a .Net developers life. This session will delve into the 'life of a bug' by taking a walk in the shoes of an everyday bug 
        from discovery to release (and the steps that make up the in between). Come along and check out the new features that will make you happier by making your code better, your 
        job easier, and your team more productive by reducing the obstacles you face in your everyday coding life. Learn:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What the new features for testers and developers </li>
            <li>How you now care - even if the tester can't reproduce the bug </li>
            <li>How to stop struggling to find the source of the bug in your code</li>
            <li>How can you streamline the testing process and make sure you don't repeat the same bugs</li>
            <li>How to automate more and reproduce bugs easier and discover problems sooner.</li>

        </ul>
        
     <strong>What's new in SharePoint 2010</strong>
        <p>In this session Adam Cogan will provide information about what is new in SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The SharePoint Team has invested in many including: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>UX support for Silverlight and Ajax </li>
            <li>their Web Content Management System </li>
            <li>Digital Asset Management System (for videos) </li>

            <li>Visual Studio 2010 tools for SharePoint 2010 </li>
            <li>Developer Platform </li>
            <li>Office 2010 integration </li>
            <li>RESTful Web API </li>
            <li>Tagging and Rating</li>
        </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together (Comparing with what with had with 2007)</li>

                <li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
                <li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by </li>
                <li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to improve visibility/searchability/versioning across the company </li>
                <li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (eg using Access and Excel) </li>
                <li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means </li>
                <li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint </li>

                <li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (eg VSTS integration with Outlook) </li>
                <li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
                <li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (eg the <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/sharepoint-connector/overview" target="_blank" class="external">Atlassian SharePoint Connector</a> and <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/office/" target="_blank" class="external">Office Connector</a>) </li>
            </ul>
        <p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session because too often companies 
        limit Office to just an email application, word processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have on the entire business process.</p>

				<p>Come and see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for Mary and the other  
                knowledge workers.</p>
			    <p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your business.</p>
                <p>Then see real world examples of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together</li>
                                <li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
                                <li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by</li>
                                <li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to improve visibility/ searchability/ versioning across the company</li>
                                <li>Overview of how data can be synchronized between SharePoint and external data sources (eg using Access and Excel)</li>
                                <li>Overview of what 'workflow' really means!</li>
                                <li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint</li>
                                <li>Extending SharePoint with Office SharePoint Designer 2010 (free!)</li>
                                <li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
                                <li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (eg the the Atlassian SharePoint Connector and Atlassian Office Connector)</li>
                            </ul>
                
				<p>
                   This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your company,  
                   along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, 
                   word processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have on the entire business process.</p>
