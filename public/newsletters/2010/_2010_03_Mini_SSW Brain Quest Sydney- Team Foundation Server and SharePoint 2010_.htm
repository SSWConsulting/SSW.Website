		<p><strong>Introducing the .NET Service Bus by Juval Lowy</strong></p>
        <p>The .NET services bus is part of the new Microsoft Cloud Computing Windows Azure 
        initiative and, arguably, it is the most accessible, ready to use, powerful, and needed 
        piece. The service bus allows clients to connects to services across any machine, 
        network, firewall, NAT, routers, load balancers, virtualization, IP and DNS as if 
        they were part of the same local network, and doing all that without compromising 
        on the programming model or security. The service bus also supports callbacks, event 
        publishing, authentication and authorization and doing all that in a WCF-friendly 
        manner. This session will present the service bus programming model, how to configure 
        and administer service bus solutions, working with the dedicated relay bindings including 
        the available communication modes, relying on authentication in the cloud for local 
        services and the various authentication options, and how to provide for end-to-end 
        security through the relay service. You will also see some advanced WCF programming 
        techniques, original helper classes, productivity-enhancing utilities and tools, as 
        well as discussion of design best practices and pitfalls. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Discover a new WCF with Discovery by Juval Lowy</strong></p>

        <p>Up until WCF 4.0, the service address had to be known in advance to the client. 
        This complicated deployment and run time configuration. In addition, the service 
        had no way of knowing that its port or pipe is available for use in the first place. 
        With WCF 4.0, you can use service address discovery to address both issues. The client 
        can discover at run time the service address, and the service can pick up any available 
        address on the fly. WCF also offers announcements of the service when its goes on or 
        off line, and scoping of the discovered services. Moreover, it turns out that discovery 
        opens the door for new ways of composing applications and new design patterns for 
        distributing information in the system. This session starts by discussing the basic 
        support of discovery in WCF and then presents helper classes that streamline the 
        interaction with discovery both on the client and the service side and the related 
        design patterns, including a framework for a discovery-based publish-subscribe system.</p>

                    <strong>Team Foundation Server 2010 for Successful Project Management</strong></p>
        <p>
        Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft .NET platform. 
        These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software development process.</p>
        <p>
        Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS Champ and Chief Architect from SSW show you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to successfully gather requirements with User stories </li>
                <li>The right way to use work items </li>
                <li>The way to complete a work items and send a 'done' </li>
                <li>How to use templates for your standard work items </li>
                <li>The extra work items that developers always forget </li>
                <li>What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration </li>
                <li>What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the Project portals available from the SharePoint dashboard </li>
                <li>The important reports to give your Project Manager </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
        Walk away knowing how to see your project health and progress. Visual Studio Ultimate is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by project managers. 
        It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help teams improve their software development activities and to help project managers better support the software 
        development processes.</p>
        <p>
        During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and tracking of releases using Visual Studio Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.</p>
 
		<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Team System - An Overview </strong>
        <p>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team System is an integrated software development platform to build the mission-critical applications that businesses depend on. It extends 
        Visual Studio's integrated and productive experience from the developer to the entire development team by delivering powerful new role-based tools for software architects, 
        developers, testers and project managers. In this session you will see an overview of these tools and how they can improve your software development cycle. </p>
        
    <strong>Visual Studio 2010 Testing with Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2010 - the life of a bug </strong>
        <p>Visual Studio 2010 makes up a large part of a .Net developers life. This session will delve into the 'life of a bug' by taking a walk in the shoes of an everyday bug 
        from discovery to release (and the steps that make up the in between). Come along and check out the new features that will make you happier by making your code better, your 
        job easier, and your team more productive by reducing the obstacles you face in your everyday coding life. Learn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What the new features are for testers and developers </li>
            <li>How you now care - even if the tester can't reproduce the bug </li>
            <li>How to stop struggling to find the source of the bug in your code</li>
            <li>How can you streamline the testing process and make sure you don't repeat the same bugs</li>
            <li>How to automate more and reproduce bugs easier and discover problems sooner.</li>
        </ul>
        
     <strong>What's new in SharePoint 2010</strong>
        <p>In this session Adam Cogan will provide information about what is new in SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The SharePoint Team has invested in many including: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>UX support for Silverlight and Ajax </li>
            <li>Their Web Content Management System </li>
            <li>Digital Asset Management System (for videos) </li>
            <li>Visual Studio 2010 tools for SharePoint 2010 </li>
            <li>Developer Platform </li>
            <li>Office 2010 integration </li>
            <li>RESTful Web API </li>
            <li>Tagging and Rating</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lets see what's good and what's not.</p>
        
     <strong>Something About Mary (SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010)</strong>
        <p>
        Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for Mary and the other knowledge workers.</p>
        <p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your business. Then see real world examples of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together</li>
                <li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
                <li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes (separate
                    from SharePoint)</li>
                <li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to improve
                    visibility/searchability/versioning across the company</li>
                <li>Overview of how data can be synchronized between SharePoint and external data sources (eg using Access and Excel)</li>
                <li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means</li>
                <li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint</li>
                <li>Extending SharePoint with Office SharePoint Designer 2010 (free!)</li>
                <li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
                <li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations 
                (eg the the Atlassian SharePoint Connector and Atlassian Office Connector)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session because too often companies 
        limit Office to just an email application, word processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have on the entire business process.</p>
