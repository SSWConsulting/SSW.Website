				<p>G'Day Developers!</p>
				
				<p>
				    This month we have a special treat. We have Steve Forte (the CTO of Telerik 
				    and #1 speaker at TechEd) presenting a half day workshop and a User Group on 
				    Scrum for SSW.
				</p>
				<p>
				    What is Scrum?</p>
                <p>
				    Scrum has been used to develop complex products since the early 1990s. Scrum is 
                    not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a framework 
                    within which you can employ various processes and techniques. The role of Scrum 
                    is to surface the relative efficacy of your development practices so that you 
                    can improve upon them while providing a framework within which complex products 
                    can be developed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Real world example:
                </p>
			    <p>
			        SSW historically gave out individual consultants but we're now finding more 
			        and more that our clients want an experienced team who can hit the ground 
			        running. For example: in the old days when we needed to do a Windows forms 
			        migration to ASP.NET, a client would engage a single SSW consultant for about 
			        4 months to do the job. Recently we had a similar project (ASP.NET to SharePoint 
			        2010 migration and we used a Scrum team of 4 guys who knocked the project over 
			        in 3 weeks.
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        Who uses it:
			    </p>
			    <p>
			        Scrum is used all around the world and by companies like Microsoft, IBM, Sun, 
			        Intel, Google, Yahoo, Oracle, Hewlett Packard, Sony Ericcson, Cisco, Philips, BBC, 
			        Motorola, JPMorgan, CapitalOne, Alliance, Electronic Arts, DoubleClick, SalesForce.com, 
			        Nokia, Siemens, Xerox, SSW and lots more 
			    </p>

				<p><strong>Agile Development, Tools and Teams</strong></p>
				<p>One of the most popular Agile project management and development methods, Scrum 
                    is starting to be adopted at major corporations and on very large projects. 
                    After an introduction to the basics of Scrum like: project planning and 
                    estimation, the Scrum Master, team, product owner and burn down, and of course 
                    the daily Scrum, Stephen (a certified Scrum Master) shows many real world 
                    applications of the methodology drawn from his own experience as a Scrum Master. </p>
				<p>Negotiating with the business, estimation and team dynamics are all discussed as 
                    well as how to use Scrum in small organizations, large enterprise environments 
                    and consulting environments. Stephen will also discuss using Scrum with virtual 
                    teams and an off-shoring environment. We'll then take a look at the tools we 
                    will use for Agile development, including planning poker, unit testing, and much 
                    more. There will be plenty of time for Question and Answer. This seminar is a 
                    jump start for a certified scrum master exam.  </p>

        <p>
            Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team 
            Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft 
            .NET platform. These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful 
            projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software 
            development process.</p>

        <p>
            Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS Champ and Chief 
            Architect from SSW show you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to successfully gather requirements with User stories </li>
                <li>The right way to use work items </li>
                <li>The way to complete a work items and send a 'done' </li>
                <li>Use templates for your standard work items </li>

                <li>The extra work items that developers always forget </li>
                <li>What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration </li>
                <li>What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the Project portals 
                    available on from the SharePoint dashboard </li>
                <li>The important reports to give your Project Manager </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress. Visual Studio 
            Ultimate is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by 
            project managers. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help 
            teams improve their software development activities and to help project managers 
            better support the software development processes.</p>

        <p>
            During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and 
            tracking of releases using Visual Studio Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.</p>

    <strong>Visual Studio 2010 Team System - An Overview </strong>
        <p>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team System is an integrated software development 
            platform to build the mission-critical applications that businesses depend on. 
            It extends Visual Studio's integrated and productive experience from the 
            developer to the entire development team by delivering powerful new role-based 
            tools for software architects, developers, testers and project managers. In this 
            session you will see an overview of these tools and how they can improve your 
            software development cycle. </p>
        
    <strong>Visual Studio 2010 Testing with Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2010 - the life of a 
                bug </strong>
        <p>Visual Studio 2010 makes up a large part of a .Net developers life. This session 
            will delve into the 'life of a bug' by taking a walk in the shoes of an everyday 
            bug from discovery to release (and the steps that make up the in between). Come 
            along and check out the new features that will make you happier by making your 
            code better, your job easier, and your team more productive by reducing the 
            obstacles you face in your everyday coding life. Learn:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What the new features for testers and developers </li>
            <li>How you now care - even if the tester can't reproduce the bug </li>
            <li>How to stop struggling to find the source of the bug in your code</li>
            <li>How can you streamline the testing process and make sure you don't repeat the 
                same bugs</li>
            <li>How to automate more and reproduce bugs easier and discover problems sooner.</li>

        </ul>
        
     <strong>What's new in SharePoint 2010</strong>
        <p>In this session Adam Cogan will provide information about what is new in 
            SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The SharePoint Team has invested in 
            many including: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>UX support for Silverlight and Ajax </li>
            <li>their Web Content Management System </li>
            <li>Digital Asset Management System (for videos) </li>

            <li>Visual Studio 2010 tools for SharePoint 2010 </li>

            <li>Office 2010 integration </li>
            <li>RESTful Web API </li>
            <li>Tagging and Rating</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Lets see what's good and what's not.</p>
        
     <strong>Something About Mary (SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010)</strong>
        <p>
            Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for Mary 
            and the other knowledge workers.</p>
        <p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your 
            business. Then see real world examples of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together (Comparing with what with had 
                    with 2007)</li>

                <li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
                <li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes 
                    (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by </li>
                <li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to 
                    improve visibility/searchability/versioning across the company </li>
                <li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (eg using Access and 
                    Excel) </li>
                <li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means </li>
                <li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint </li>

                <li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (eg VSTS

                <li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
                <li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (eg the <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/sharepoint/" target="_blank" class="external">
                    Atlassian SharePoint Connector</a> and <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/office/" target="_blank" class="external">
                    Office Connector</a>) </li>
            </ul>
        <p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your 
            company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session 
            because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word 
            processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have 
            on the entire business process.</p>

				<p>Come and see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for 
                    Mary and the other knowledge workers.</p>
			    <p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your 
                    business.</p>
                <p>Then see real world examples of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together</li>
                                <li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
                                <li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes 
                                    (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by</li>
                                <li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to 
                                    improve visibility/ searchability/ versioning across the company</li>
                                <li>Overview of how data can be synchronized between SharePoint and external data 
                                    sources (eg using Access and Excel)</li>
                                <li>Overview of what 'workflow' really means!</li>
                                <li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint</li>
                                <li>Extending SharePoint with Office SharePoint Designer 2010 (free!)</li>
                                <li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
                                <li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (eg the the 
                                    Atlassian SharePoint Connector and Atlassian Office Connector)</li>
                            </ul>
                
				<p>
                    This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your 
                    company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session 
                    because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word 
                    processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have 
                    on the entire business process.</p>
