  'SSW Data PRO! Renovator' (97 &amp; 2000) is a productivity tool utility that 
  can make your life easier! <br>
  With SSW Data PRO! Renovator and its friendly interface you can compare two 
  databases structure and: <br>
  &middot; Generate difference reports for you to make the changes manually, or 
  <br>
  &middot; Step through the wizard and the data will be AUTOMATICALLY moved into 
  the new structure (renames are it's strongest feature) <br>

<p>5. Hot Tips</p>
<p>&middot; The StrConv Function <br>
  &middot; Simplifying Debugging</p>
<p> <br>
  1) The StrConv Function<br>
  If you have problems with the formatting of sting data, the StrConv function 
  can be useful. <br>
  For example, you may wish to convert a name of &quot;JOE BLOGGS&quot; to proper 
  case i.e &quot;Joe Bloggs&quot;, or you may wish to convert from lower to upper 
  case. <br>
  For example, to convert all data in a field to proper case, you could use:</p>
<p>StrConv([User_Name],3)</p>
<p>or to convert to upper case, you could use:</p>
<p>StrConv([User_Name],1)</p>
<p>Thanks to David Klein for this tip<br>
  <br>
  2) Use Resume 0 to simplify debugging.</p>
<p>If you get an error, hit Ctrl-Break at the error msgbox and the code window 
  appears with the msgbox command highlighted. Place the cursor on the Resume 
  0 and hit Ctrl-F9 (set next line) then Ctrl-F8 (step one line) and you are back 
  at the line that caused the error. I automatically add &quot;Resume 0 'For debugging&quot; 
  to the end of all error handlers for this purpose.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ted Avery for this tip</p>
