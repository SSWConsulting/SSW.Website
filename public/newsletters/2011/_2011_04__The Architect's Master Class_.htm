                    The Architect's Master Class is a 5 days training, and is the ultimate resource for the professional architect. The class is 
                    conducted in the style of a Master Class, where a Master architect shares his experience and perspective, and interacts with 
                    the students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The class has three parts, on process, technology & SOA, and the IDesign method for analysis and design. The class shows the 
                    architect how to take an active leadership role on all three aspects, as a continuum, since when executing a design, one cannot 
                    separate process from design from technology - all three have to work in concert. While the class shows how to design modern 
                    systems, it sets the focus on the 'why' and the rationale behind particular design decisions, often shedding light on poorly 
                    understood aspects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will see relevant design guidelines, best practices, and pitfalls, and the crucial process required of today's modern 
                    architects. Don't miss on this unique opportunity to learn and improve your architecture skills with IDesign, and share 
                    their passion for architecture and software engineering.

        <p><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong></p>
        <p>Speaker: Stephen Godbold</p>
        <p>
            We've all heard the story of Flickr and their multiple production deployments in a single day. It sounds like 
            a great place to be, but like the slogan says 'it won't happen overnight'. In this session Steve Godbold will 
            take you through some of the practices that facilitate this kind of rapid response to change. We'll look at 
            some of the principals that make up a continuous delivery pipeline, how they are applied through the practices, 
            and how to work out which areas to tackle in an existing pipeline.

                    Adam Cogan</a></strong></p>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team 
            Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft 
            .NET platform. These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful 
            projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software 
            development process.
        </p>

        <p>
            Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS Champ and Chief 
            Architect from SSW show you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to successfully gather requirements with User stories </li>
                <li>The right way to use work items </li>
                <li>The way to complete a work items and send a 'done' </li>
                <li>Use templates for your standard work items </li>

                <li>The extra work items that developers always forget </li>
                <li>What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration </li>
                <li>What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the Project portals 
                    available on from the SharePoint dashboard </li>
                <li>The important reports to give your Project Manager </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress. Visual Studio 
            Ultimate is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by 
            project managers. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help 
            teams improve their software development activities and to help project managers 
            better support the software development processes.</p>

        <p>
            During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and 
            tracking of releases using Visual Studio Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.</p>

    <strong>Visual Studio 2010 Team System - An Overview </strong>
        <p>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team System is an integrated software development 
            platform to build the mission-critical applications that businesses depend on. 
            It extends Visual Studio's integrated and productive experience from the 
            developer to the entire development team by delivering powerful new role-based 
            tools for software architects, developers, testers and project managers. In this 
            session you will see an overview of these tools and how they can improve your 
            software development cycle. </p>
        
    <strong>Visual Studio 2010 Testing with Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2010 - the life of a 
                bug </strong>
        <p>Visual Studio 2010 makes up a large part of a .Net developers life. This session 
            will delve into the 'life of a bug' by taking a walk in the shoes of an everyday 
            bug from discovery to release (and the steps that make up the in between). Come 
            along and check out the new features that will make you happier by making your 
            code better, your job easier, and your team more productive by reducing the 
            obstacles you face in your everyday coding life. Learn:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What the new features for testers and developers </li>
            <li>How you now care - even if the tester can't reproduce the bug </li>
            <li>How to stop struggling to find the source of the bug in your code</li>
            <li>How can you streamline the testing process and make sure you don't repeat the 
                same bugs</li>
            <li>How to automate more and reproduce bugs easier and discover problems sooner.</li>

        </ul>
        
     <strong>What's new in SharePoint 2010</strong>
        <p>In this session Adam Cogan will provide information about what is new in 
            SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The SharePoint Team has invested in 
            many including: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>UX support for Silverlight and Ajax </li>
            <li>their Web Content Management System </li>
            <li>Digital Asset Management System (for videos) </li>

            <li>Visual Studio 2010 tools for SharePoint 2010 </li>

     <strong>Something About Mary (SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010)</strong>
        <p>
            Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for Mary 
            and the other knowledge workers.</p>
        <p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your 
            business. Then see real world examples of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together (Comparing with what with had 
                    with 2007)</li>

                <li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
                <li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes 
                    (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by </li>
                <li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to 
                    improve visibility/searchability/versioning across the company </li>
                <li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (e.g. using Access and 
                    Excel) </li>
                <li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means </li>
                <li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint </li>

                <li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (e.g. VSTS 
                    integration with Outlook) </li>
                <li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>
                <li>Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations (e.g. the <a href="http://www.atlassian.com" target="_blank" class="external">
                    Atlassian SharePoint Connector</a> and <a href="http://www.atlassian.com" target="_blank" class="external">
                    Office Connector</a>) </li>
            </ul>
        <p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your 
            company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session 
            because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word 
            processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have 
            on the entire business process.</p>
