  1. THE ACCESS/ASP/SQL SERVER USER GROUP <br>
  =================================================== </p>
<p>The MARCH &quot;Microsoft Access/ASP/SQL Server User Group, Sydney&quot; is 
  scheduled for Wednesday 15th February 2000, 5:45 pm </p>
<p>1) We are having a discussion on what the GST means to us and our clients (as 
  developers): </p>
<p>The ABN: Who&#146;s eligible and what does it mean? <br>
  The GST: Its impact on your business and your database. <br>
  PAG vs PAYE:The new and the old. How will these changes affect you? <br>
  BAS: The Business Activity Statement is to be lodged every three months and 
  will have a running effect on your business. </p>
<p>2) What are those DTS Tools in SQL Server? <br>
  Also Eris McEncroe will give a presentation on organising data for using Business 
  Intelligence applications ( like ad hoc query, reporting and OLAP systems). 
  Eris will cover the advantages of Star schema over Normalised database schema 
  for this type of application. The presentation will include a demo showing how 
  Data Transformation Services (DTS) can be used to restructure data into the 
  required format. DTS, which ships with SQL Server 7, enables data to be extracted 
  from just about any source, scrubbed,transformed and then pumped to a desired 
  destination. Neither sources or targets needs to be a SQL server database. The 
  whole process can be automated and scheduled to run as required.</p>
<p>Attending the user group is free and is an excellent opportunity to share ideas 
  and pick up hot development tips. </p>
<p>SSW has been running the &quot;Microsoft Access/ASP/SQL Server User Group, 
  Sydney&quot; since 1992. For more information and a map of how to get there 
  see the web site at www.ssw.com.au/AccessUG</p>

  2. DEVCON 2000 - CONFERENCE FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPERS <br>
  =================================================== <br>
  If you are serious about developing and keeping ahead of the pack, consider 
  attending DevCom2000. </p>

<p>Perth March 28 &#150; 31 The Sheraton Hotel </p>
<p>Sydney April 2 &#150; 5 The Manly Pacific Parkroyal </p>
<p>You will: <br>
  * BE THE FIRST in Australia to know about SQL Server 2000 XML and HTTP Enhancements. 
  These tools will be detailed so you will learn how to store and retrieve XML 
  from SQL Server programmatically.</p>
<p>* Be given a tool to quickly analyse the slowest forms in your database then 
  drill down and see the cause. </p>
<p>* SAVE WEEKS in your SQL Server conversion. Upsizing to SQL Server from Access 
  97 requires preparation of your back end and front end databases. We will show 
  you what to look for, walk you through the code and then give you the code and 
  preparation tool to TAKE AWAY</p>
<p>* TURN YOUR STORED PROCEDURES FROM A CHORE INTO A CINCH. Most people believe 
  that Stored Procedures are difficult to code for and it DOESN'T HELP when Microsoft 
  doesn't document real shortcuts - BUT WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW!</p>
<p>* MAXIMISE YOUR ADO PERFORMANCE. ADO is becoming the defacto standard for data 
  access all over the world. ADO is being employed to handle complex client/server 
  as well as middle tier and web based development chores. Learn how to get more 
  out ActiveX.</p>
<p>* Learn how easy it is to integrate Outlook with your database forms, how to 
  use VBA and COM add-ins,then put together an enterprise/office calendar solution 
  - ALL THE CODE IS YOURS TO TAKE AND EXPAND into your applications.</p>
<p>The aim of DevCon 2000 is for you to come away from the conference with real 
  benefits and value for money. We are confident that delegates will learn more 
  in 4 days at DevCon than 4 months in the office!</p>
