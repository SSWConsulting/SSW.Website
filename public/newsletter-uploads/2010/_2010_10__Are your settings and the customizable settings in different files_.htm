                            <h1>[<span class="magazineTitle">the cutting edge</span> ]</h1>
                            <p>G'Day Developers!</p>

                            <p>
                                There are three types of settings files that we may need to use in .NET :
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>App.Config/Web.Config is the default .NET settings file, including any settings for
                                    the Microsoft Application Blocks
                                    (e.g. the Exception Management Block and the Configuration Management Block). These
                                    are for settings that don't change from
                                    within the application. In addition, System.Configuration classes don't allow
                                    writing to this file. </li><br />
                                <li>ToolsOptions.Config (an SSW standard) is the file to hold the users own settings,
                                    that are users can change in the Tools
                                    - Options. e.g. ConnectionString, EmailTo, EmailCC<br /><br />
                                    Note: We read and write to this using Microsoft Configuration Application Block. If
                                    we don't use this Block we would
                                    store it as a plain XML file and read and write to it using System.XML classes. The
                                    idea is that if something does
                                    go wrong when you are writing to this file, at least the App.Config would not be
                                    affected. Also, this separates our
                                    settings (which are few) from the App.Config (which usually has a lot of stuff that
                                    we really don't want a user to stuff
                                    around with).
                                </li><br />
                                <li>UserSession.Config (an SSW standard). These are for additional setting files that
                                    the user cannot change. e.g. FormLocation,
                                    LastReportSelected<br /><br />
                                    Note: This file is over writable (say during a re-installation) and it will not
                                    affect the user if the file is deleted.
                                </li><br />
                            </ol>

                                Over the past 18 months, ASP.NET MVC has been making great leaps and bounds and just
                                released the new ASP.NET
                                MVC 3 Beta to all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Come see Justin show you how to get up to speed with ASP.NET MVC. We will cover the
                                basics
                                of ASP.NET MVC 2/3 such as Controllers, Views, Models, Helpers, Routing, Templating,
                                Areas and Validation
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This will be a demo focussed session that will also cover the new Razor syntax View
                                Engine and a run through
                                of the NuPack integration that was also included in this Beta to add packages to your
                                website quickly.

                                .NET platform. These are the best tools for a project manager to have successful
                                projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software

                                SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The SharePoint Team has invested in
                                many including: </p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>
                                Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint and Office for Mary
                                and the other knowledge workers.</p>
                            <p>First you will get an overview of what is great about having SharePoint in your
                                business. Then see real world examples of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together (Comparing with what with had
                                    with 2007)</li>

                                <li>Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like CRM 4 and TFS</li>
                                <li>Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into business processes
                                    (separate from SharePoint), and then followed by </li>
                                <li>Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with SharePoint to
                                    improve visibility/searchability/versioning across the company </li>
                                <li>Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two (eg using Access and
                                    Excel) </li>
                                <li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means </li>
                                <li>How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with SharePoint </li>

                                <li>High level examples of using/integrating Office with other products (eg VSTS
                                    integration with Outlook) </li>
                                <li>Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be developed </li>

                                        Atlassian SharePoint Connector</a> and <a

                            </ul>
                            <p>This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using Office in your
                                company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam gets excited about this session
                                because too often companies limit Office to just an email application, word
                                processor and spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can have
                                on the entire business process.</p>

                <p>Are you looking to eradicate bugs and ensure consistency? SSW Code Auditor is a
                    code analysis tool that allows developers to take control of your code, ensuring
                    large, complex source code can be simplified, cleaned and maintained. The built-in
                    rules focus on the most popular .NET languages (C#, VB.NET) for both Windows Forms
                    and ASP.NET; however, the flexibility of SSW Code Auditor allows the developer to
                    add their own rules to target any language in any text file.</p>
