								<p>G'Day Developers! </p>
								<p>What is the step that the client should undertake after an initial meeting? We think it should be a
									"Specification Review".
									Generally a client wants to know if his idea will be $50K or $150K.</p>
								<p>A "Specification Review" is performed to determine the overall scope, feasibility, and ballpark of
									the project. We encourage you
									to also create a detailed "Release Plan" for the first 2 releases.</p>
								<p>eg. Mr Northwind learns that the idea he presented at the initial meeting will cost approximately
									$80K and he has to determine if that is feasible to his business
									or if he should remove some functionality.</p>
								<p>The Specification Review should be paid work and is conducted by two experienced developers at the
									client premises in close
									consultation with the client. The time allocated for a Spec Review is generally 1 - 5 days depending
									on initial expectations of the project. The rule of thumb is 1 - 2 days Spec
									Review per estimated month of project time. The purpose is to understand the whole project but, if the
									project is greater than six months,
									focus primarily on the first six months. The Spec Review is a process that will demonstrate to the
									client whether you have
									the commercial sense to
									understand their **business** and have the technical and management capacity to complete the project.
								</p>
								<b>Talk Business Process</b>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Interview: </strong>During the Spec Review, obtain an overall 'outsiders' understanding of
										the business and project through an interview process with senior
										management, relevant business users and IT staff. </li>
									<li><strong>Review Documentation: </strong>Reviewing any documentation the client may already have.
										Remember clients are mostly
										looking to software consultants to assist them in solving business problems. </li>
									<li><strong>Technology: </strong>Warning: Detailed discussions about technology with the client,
										unless they have a specific business purpose, are unlikely to be useful. For example most clients
										won't be interested in a discussion about
										whether to use MVC or ASP.NET traditional at this stage.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><b>Do something valuable</b></p>
								<p>Most experts at software consulting will be able to provide a small improvement
									to the current system 'on the fly' during the Spec Review. This may be something
									as simple as adding an index to a table and thereby increasing the performance of a webpage. </p>

								<p><strong>We work efficiently on the right things in a visible way&#8230;. Looking at processes and
										tracking and time systems</strong></p>
								<p>Every IT development group gets criticised by its customers (internal and external) for not getting
									their priorities right and
									not being open about what they are actually doing. If your group all worked as efficiently as
									possible, on precisely the things
									that your customer wanted in the right priority order in such a visible way that your customer could
									change priority and know all
									the impacts, it would be virtually impossible for the customer to be critical. While it's probably
									impossible to develop and execute
									all the processes to achieve this, we can get very close and have a lot of fun and pride doing so.</p>
								<p>This talk is all about having all tracking and development information in one integrated system that
									does not include email. Emails
									should not contain information that needs to be referenced and should not be used for discussion; it
									is a good medium for reminders
									but anything useful in them should be moved to the integrated system. From one end of the spectrum a
									business stakeholder (customer)
									should be able to view the work in progress starting from a high level e.g. drilling down into a
									programme and see any amount of detail
									they wish. Similarly, a developer should be able to view what they are working on and then link up to
									the associated requirements and
									programme giving the reason for each task. Every bit of time worked by anybody should also be recorded
									on the system for both accounting
									and historical reasons. These figures can then be used for changing strategy (e.g. spend more on
									support and less on development) and
									for helping future estimates and planning.</p>
								<p>Having tried a variety of open source, commercial and home-grown systems, the presenter has chosen a
									combination of Jira and Confluence
									(both provided by Atlassian) and SVN. While these products are not the only solution, they demonstrate
									how well the processes of an organisation
									can be modelled and tracked. We are not talking bug tracking here, we are talking about tracking
									everything everybody needs and does.
									Each member of the company has a personal dashboard showing them their work outstanding together with
									priorities, dependencies, time estimates
									and due dates.</p>

								<p>Mark Hetherington is the CTO of Tilefile. He graduated from London University with an honours degree
									In Computer Science and nine years with a
									UK software house before moving to Australia. Mark helped found the Australian Centre for Unisys
									Software (ACUS) and then became its director during
									which time he grew the organization to over 150 while managing other software groups in New Zealand
									and the United States. <br />
									In 1994, he joined his first Internet startup which went on to build the successful RSVP dating
									business. He grew this company to over one hundred
									staff before moving on. In 1999, he moved to Seattle to be responsible for building the first airborne
									Internet server which sent the first email from a plane less than a
									year later while growing the company from 18 to over 100. <br />
									After launching his own award-winning (Consensus Software Award) Internet service in 2003, he spent a
									year in Vancouver rescuing a poor-performing
									gaming software organization by introducing good process and helping move the share price from a few
									cents to over $3. He was the CIO of Mooter Media from 2005 to 2007 where he built the software
									organization and deployed the application to dozens of servers in
									China where it served over 200 million individually selected advert impressions per day.<br />
									His expertise lies in software engineering process, operational process, high throughput web systems,
									system architecture &amp; staff management. <br />
									He joined Tilefile in May 2007 where his vast experience has admirably complimented the young,
									talented and creative engineering team.</p>

								<p><strong>ASP.NET MVC Preview 2 Presented by Tatham Oddie</strong></p>
								<p>What is this whole MVC thing anyway? Hot on the heels of MIX08 and last week&#8217;s release of
									ASP.NET
									MVC Preview 2, Tatham Oddie will demonstrate how to use the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern to
									take advantage of your favourite .NET Framework language for writing business logic in a way that
									is de-coupled from the views of the data. We&#8217;ll discuss the advantages to MVC on the web, the

								<p><strong>Internet Explorer 8 for Developers Presented by Tatham Oddie</strong></p>
								<p>The release of Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1 demonstrates some exciting new technologies for developers.
									These technologies are open standards, and implementations are already being worked on in the Firefox
									and Safari camps too. In 20 minutes we&#8217;ll do a lap of activities, WebSlices and the new
