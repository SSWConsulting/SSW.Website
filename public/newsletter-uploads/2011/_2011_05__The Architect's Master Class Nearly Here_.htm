							<p>
								The Architect's Master Class is a 5 day training course, and
								is the ultimate resource for the professional architect. The
								class is conducted in the style of a Master Class, where a
								Master architect shares his experience and perspective, and
								interacts with his students.
							</p>
							<p>
								The class has three parts, on process, technology & SOA, and
								the IDesign method for analysis and design. The class shows
								the architect how to take an active leadership role on all
								three aspects, as a continuum, since when executing a design,
								one cannot separate process, design and technology - all three
								have to work in concert. While the class shows how to design
								modern systems, it sets the focus on the 'why' and the
								rationale behind particular design decisions, often shedding
								light on poorly understood aspects.
							</p>
							<p>
								You will see relevant design guidelines, best practices, and
								pitfalls, and the crucial process required of today's modern
								architects. Don't miss out on this unique opportunity to learn
								and improve your architecture skills with IDesign, and share
								their passion for architecture and software engineering.

							</p>
							<p>
								Visual Studio Ultimate (formerly Visual Studio Team System
								(VSTS)) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones
								of development on the Microsoft .NET platform. These are the
								best tools for a project manager to have successful projects
								and for developers to have a focused and smooth software
								development process.
							</p>
							<p>
								Come and see Adam Cogan, Microsoft Regional Director, VSTS
								Champ and Chief Architect from SSW show you:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									How to successfully gather requirements with User stories
								</li>
								<li>The right way to use work items</li>
								<li>The way to complete a work item and send a 'done'</li>
								<li>Use templates for your standard work items</li>

								<li>The extra work items that developers always forget</li>
								<li>
									What is good and bad about Excel and Project integration
								</li>
								<li>
									What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the
									Project portals available on from the SharePoint dashboard
								</li>
								<li>The important reports to give your Project Manager</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress.
								Visual Studio Ultimate is designed to help address many of
								these traditional problems faced by project managers. It does
								so by providing a set of integrated tools to help teams
								improve their software development activities and to help
								project managers better support the software development
								processes.
							</p>
							<p>
								During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating
								work items and tracking of releases using Visual Studio
								Ultimate and Team Foundation Server.
							</p>

							<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Team System - An Overview </strong>
							<p>
								Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team System is an integrated
								software development platform to build the mission-critical
								applications that businesses depend on. It extends Visual
								Studio's integrated and productive experience from the
								developer to the entire development team by delivering
								powerful new role-based tools for software architects,
								developers, testers and project managers. In this session you
								will see an overview of these tools and how they can improve
								your software development cycle.
							</p>

							<strong>Visual Studio 2010 Testing with Team Foundation Server (TFS)
								2010 - the life of a bug
							</strong>
							<p>
								Visual Studio 2010 makes up a large part of a .Net developers
								life. This session will delve into the 'life of a bug' by
								taking a walk in the shoes of an everyday bug from discovery
								to release (and the steps that make up the in between). Come
								along and check out the new features that will make you
								happier by making your code better, your job easier, and your
								team more productive by reducing the obstacles you face in
								your everyday coding life. Learn:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>What the new features for testers and developers</li>
								<li>
									How you now care - even if a tester can't reproduce the bug
								</li>
								<li>
									How to stop struggling to find the source of the bug in your
									code
								</li>
								<li>
									How can you streamline the testing process and make sure you
									don't repeat the same bugs
								</li>
								<li>
									How to automate more and reproduce bugs easier and discover
									problems sooner.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<strong>What's new in SharePoint 2010</strong>
							<p>
								In this session Adam Cogan will provide information about what
								is new in SharePoint 2010 and his personal favorites. The
								SharePoint Team has invested in many including:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>UX support for Silverlight and Ajax</li>
								<li>their Web Content Management System</li>
								<li>Digital Asset Management System (for videos)</li>

								<li>Visual Studio 2010 tools for SharePoint 2010</li>
								<li>Developer Platform</li>
								<li>Office 2010 integration</li>
								<li>RESTful Web API</li>
								<li>Tagging and Rating</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Let's see what's good and what's not.</p>

							<strong>Something About Mary (SharePoint 2010 and Office
								2010)</strong>
							<p>
								Come see Adam Cogan explain what works well with SharePoint
								and Office for Mary and the other knowledge workers.
							</p>
							<p>
								First you will get an overview of what is great about having
								SharePoint in your business. Then see real world examples of:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Using SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 together (Comparing
									with what with had with 2007)
								</li>

								<li>
									Where it fits with other important Microsoft products like
									CRM 4 and TFS
								</li>
								<li>
									Examples of how Word and Excel can be integrated into
									business processes (separate from SharePoint), and then
									followed by
								</li>
								<li>
									Examples of how Word, Excel, PowerPoint can be combined with
									SharePoint to improve visibility/searchability/versioning
									across the company
								</li>
								<li>
									Overview of how data can be synchronised between the two
									(e.g. using Access and Excel)
								</li>
								<li>Overview of what 'workflow' (really!) means</li>
								<li>
									How Office can be incorporated into company workflows with
									SharePoint
								</li>

								<li>
									High level examples of using/integrating Office with other
									products (e.g. VSTS integration with Outlook)
								</li>
								<li>
									Where VBA and VSTO fit in terms of how solutions can be
									developed
								</li>
								<li>
									Examples of other interesting Office/SharePoint integrations
									(e.g. the
									<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/sharepoint-connector/overview" target="_blank"
										class="external">
										Atlassian SharePoint Connector</a>
									and
									<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/office?utm_source=SSW%2BUpdate%2BMay&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=SSW%2BUpdate%2B-%2BThe%2BArchitect's%2BMaster%2BClass%2BNearly%2BHere"
										target="_blank" class="external">
										Office Connector</a>)
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								This is a good chance for you to consider new ways of using
								Office in your company, along with pitfalls to avoid. Adam
								gets excited about this session because too often companies
								limit Office to just an email application, word processor and
								spreadsheet - completely missing the positive impact it can
								have on the entire business process.

							<p><strong> Overview </strong></p>
							<p>
								This Scrum Developer course is a unique and intensive five-day
								experience for software developers. The course guides teams on
								how to turn product requirements into potentially shippable
								increments of software using the Scrum framework, Visual
								Studio 2010, and modern software engineering practices.
								Attendees will work in self-organizing, self-managing teams
								using a common instance of Visual Studio Team Foundation
								Server 2010 to achieve this goal.

								Are you looking to eradicate bugs and ensure consistency? SSW
								Code Auditor is a code analysis tool that allows developers to
								take control of your code, ensuring large, complex source code
								can be simplified, cleaned and maintained. The built-in rules
								focus on the most popular .NET languages (C#, VB.NET) for both
								Windows Forms and ASP.NET; however, the flexibility of SSW
								Code Auditor allows the developer to add their own rules to
								target any language in any text file.
