                            </p>

                            <p>The benefits of continually improving our processes and practices around the Scrum
                                methodology were never more apparent than with the project we have recently completed
                                for Brisbane Catholic Education (BCE).<br />
                                As developers, we’ve all worked on projects where the level of collaboration can break
                                down due to any number of factors such as scope creep, availability of the Product
                                Owner, ill-defined requirements or inadequate testing. One of the strongest benefits of
                                Scrum is the focus on communication and feedback to alleviate these symptoms.</p>

                            <p><strong>The BCE SPARROW Project</strong><br />
                                The SPARROW project is an extranet site designed to assist school principals when
                                performing long term strategic planning for their school. As such, this was a project
                                with many stakeholders.<br />
                                On arrival, we found that BCE were ready for Scrum. They had tried applying agile
                                principles to their own projects previously and were interested in formalizing the
                                process. Following Scrum helped us to build a single collaborative development team
                                comprising developers and a designer from SSW with testers and IT staff from BCE. The
                                SSW team for this project included

                    Professional Scrum Developer courses teach students how to work in a team - using modern software
                    engineering practices - to develop
                    an increment of potentially releasable functionality using a specific technology platform.

                    Classes are exercise-driven, with students working in self-organizing teams to develop "done"
                    increments from Product Backlog items.

                    This 3-day Professional Scrum Developer .NET course is a mix of lecture, demonstration, group
                    discussion, simulation, and hands-on
                    software development. The bulk of the course will be spent working as a team on a case study
                    application delivering increments of new
                    functionality in mini-sprints. Here is the course at a glance:

                        Anderson</strong></p>

                <p>It is widely accepted in the industry that messaging patterns like CQRS can facilitate massively
                    scalable applications with loosely coupled components.
                    Tribe takes a different approach to current single page web application frameworks by providing a
                    full composite UI framework with a messaging platform
                    at its core. This enables the rapid development of highly scalable applications built on patterns
                    like CQRS in a simple and intuitive way. The platform also
                    enables seamless, real time distribution of objects on a large scale across multiple devices.</p>

                <p>First, we'll briefly discuss some of the concepts behind messaging patterns like CQRS. Then we'll
                    build a simple chat application that targets both browsers
                    and mobile devices (hopefully using a preview of the upcoming nodejs based release), showcasing how
                    Tribe is focused around removing common pain points and
                    repetitive tasks in developing web applications. Finally we'll cover how the concepts discussed
                    earlier can be applied using the platform and have a quick
                    look at the product roadmap.</p>

                    Dale Anderson is an exceptionally passionate software engineer. He lives and breathes the stuff
                    every day and loves every moment.</p>

                <p>Lucky to have been born in the age when Steve Jobs was busy changing the world, Dale fondly remembers
                    hacking on his dad's Apple
                    II Plus as a youngster, fervently and conscientiously transcribing code from the pages of computing
                    magazines and then excitedly watching
                    the green ASCII characters fly across the screen as the program came to life. Later, the idea of
                    networking computers together fascinated
                    him, driving his parents crazy by tying up the phone line for hours on end as the modem clicked and
                    buzzed away at a blazing 2,400 bits
                    every second. Dale was even nerdy enough to read the entire RFC specifications for the TCP/IP
                    protocols and various other incredibly
                    dry pieces of literature.</p>

                <p>Dale has spent most of his 13+ year career focused on the Microsoft technology stack, working with a
                    wide range of government and corporate
                    clients, specialising in solution architecture. He has in depth knowledge of a broad range of
                    Microsoft technologies, covering web, desktop
                    and middleware stacks. Over the last few years, Dale founded a startup, SportingTribe, and in the
                    process, has become an expert in open source web
                    technologies. He has produced a number of open source projects in that domain (<a

                        Anderson</strong></p>

                <p>It is widely accepted in the industry that messaging patterns like CQRS can facilitate massively
                    scalable applications with loosely coupled components.
                    Tribe takes a different approach to current single page web application frameworks by providing a
                    full composite UI framework with a messaging platform
                    at its core. This enables the rapid development of highly scalable applications built on patterns
                    like CQRS in a simple and intuitive way. The platform also
                    enables seamless, real time distribution of objects on a large scale across multiple devices.</p>

                <p>First, we'll briefly discuss some of the concepts behind messaging patterns like CQRS. Then we'll
                    build a simple chat application that targets both browsers
                    and mobile devices (hopefully using a preview of the upcoming nodejs based release), showcasing how
                    Tribe is focused around removing common pain points and
                    repetitive tasks in developing web applications. Finally we'll cover how the concepts discussed
                    earlier can be applied using the platform and have a quick
                    look at the product roadmap.</p>

                <p><b>About the presenter:</b><br />
                    Dale Anderson is an exceptionally passionate software engineer. He lives and breathes the stuff
                    every day and loves every moment.</p>

                <p>Lucky to have been born in the age when Steve Jobs was busy changing the world, Dale fondly remembers
                    hacking on his dad's Apple
                    II Plus as a youngster, fervently and conscientiously transcribing code from the pages of computing
                    magazines and then excitedly watching
                    the green ASCII characters fly across the screen as the program came to life. Later, the idea of
                    networking computers together fascinated
                    him, driving his parents crazy by tying up the phone line for hours on end as the modem clicked and
                    buzzed away at a blazing 2,400 bits
                    every second. Dale was even nerdy enough to read the entire RFC specifications for the TCP/IP
                    protocols and various other incredibly
                    dry pieces of literature.</p>

                <p>Dale has spent most of his 13+ year career focused on the Microsoft technology stack, working with a
                    wide range of government and corporate
                    clients, specialising in solution architecture. He has in depth knowledge of a broad range of
