                        <p><b>G'day Developers!</b></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>At SSW we spend a lot of time improving our processes to get solutions tested and into
                            production as efficiently as possible. Part of this
                            effort is implementing continuous deployment using Team Foundation Server and MS Build.</p>
                        <p>You may have noticed the footer on https://www.ssw.com.au announcing that our website is under
                            constant continuous deployment. That means
                            whenever one of our developers checks in a change to the website into TFS, the website is
                            built, all tests are run, and it’s deployed straight
                            to our servers. All this without any manual intervention!</p>
                        <p>It’s not just our internal projects that are under continuous deployment, however. We have
                            implemented similar stories for many of our clients
                            enabling us to push automatically-tested changes directly to staging servers without any
                            manual intervention. That way, even small changes will
                            be immediately available for testing. This process saves a huge amount of time and lets our
                            developers focus on what really matters – writing
                            great products for our clients.</p>
                        <p>Want to implement continuous integration, TFS or improve your build and deployment process in
                            your organisation? Call us on +61 2 9953 3000 to speak to one of our experts.</p></br>

                    <p>Juval Löwy's Architecture Clinics offer instruction on the IDesign Method along with obtaining
                        practical experience through a comprehensive hands-on
                        approach. The clinic combines elements of teamwork, peer-critiqued, and an IDesign Master
                        architect review, which allows each participant to depart
                        not only with the architecture and design diagrams for their particular system, but also with
                        expertise that would otherwise take years of
                        on-the-job-experience to obtain.</p>
                    <p>The Architecture Clinic is designed to guide and accelerate your exposure to the practices of
                        modern software design. It is a 5 day highly interactive
                        event where you will learn, improve, and exercise software architecture skills, all based on the
                        IDesign Method – a breakthrough, battle-proven approach
                        to software architecture that has shown up to 80% reduction in the effort and time required for
                        architecting, designing, and implementing software
                        solutions. Through its application, it produces an easy-to-follow blueprint for the construction
                        of a software system, while covering all the
                        important aspects involved.</p>
                    <p>During the Clinic, you will architect several systems, most of them based on real-world problems
                        brought in by the Clinic’s participants (and you may
                        offer a system for the team to work on as well, which could be a nice side benefit). Through
                        guided practice, you will exercise the IDesign Method and
                        become proficient at it - the Clinic will be run by an IDesign Architect. Along the way we will
                        walk you through the steps of the Method, share insight,
                        inform best practices, and also help develop the “soft skills” that are so important to success.
                        In normal day-to-day work, this type of knowledge and
                        insight can take many years to attain. The Clinic will shorten your learning curve through our
                        years of deep industry experience, and provide a
                        perfect forum for focused, high caliber discussions and mentorship.</p>

                                software engineering practices, to develop

                                platform. Students learn to do so within the Scrum

                                “done” increments from Product Backlog items. </p>

            <p>Written and presented by industry experts, this intensive five-day workshop gives professional developers
                the information and hands-on experience they
                need to deliver state-of-the-art, integrated reporting and analytics solutions using Microsoft Business
                Intelligence.</p>
            <p>Delivering the right information in the right format at the right time to all users in the
                organization—that is Microsoft’s Business Intelligence (BI)
                strategy and vision for enterprise information management. Microsoft’s integrated BI tools enable
                developers to create effective solutions that information
                workers use every day to find meaningful patterns in the vast sea of data they collect and to use that
                insight to quickly respond to changing business conditions.</p>
            <p>On completion of this workshop attendees will be able to position different types of Business
                Intelligence solutions, from enterprise data warehousing to data
                marts to real-time operational reporting and analytics. Attendees will learn how to design and build
                powerful integrated solutions that provide users with
                rich reporting, analysis, visualization and performance management capabilities by targeting operational
                data from an existing line-of-business application
                using the Microsoft Business Intelligence platform.</p>
            <p>Attendees will work through 32 practical hands-on labs to build a complete BI solution by the end of the
                workshop.</p>

    <p>SharePoint 2010 is a very powerful collaboration tool and one of Microsoft's most popular business products. Many

            <p>Speaker: John Bristowe</p>
            <p>Kendo UI is a HTML5, jQuery-based framework for building modern HTML apps. Kendo UI combines the best of
                emerging HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
                technologies with robust, cross-browser techniques to deliver a framework that is both powerfully rich
                and broadly compatible with older browsers.</p>
            <p>In this session, you'll learn how Kendo UI combines everything that a developer needs to build a rich
                JavaScript app, eliminating the traditional
                challenge of manually researching and combining all of the needed plug-ins, frameworks, and libraries
                needed to build apps.</p>

            <p><strong>From Desktop to Everywhere with ASP.NET MVC 3 and 4</strong></p>
            <p>Speaker: Damian Brady</p>
            <p>Mobile devices like tablets and phones are quickly becoming the primary way people access the web. So why
                do so many websites still provide
                a horrible mobile experience?</p>
            <p>With ASP.NET MVC, it's easier than ever to literally put your site in the palm of everyone's hand. MVC 3
                has many features that allow you to
                target mobile devices with different layout and even content. The recent developer preview of MVC 4
                makes things even easier and shows that
                Microsoft is really thinking about web-enabled devices.</p>
            <p>In this demo-heavy session, Damian Brady will show some different techniques and third-party libraries
                that make targeting mobile devices easy,
                both in MVC3 and in the Developer Preview of MVC4.</p>
            <p><i>NB: If you saw Damian's talk at DDD Brisbane last November, rest assured he’ll be delving even deeper
                    into the best way to target mobile
                    sites and he’ll focus more on what MVC 4 will bring to the table.</i></p>
