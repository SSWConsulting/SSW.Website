            <p>SharePoint 2010 is a very powerful collaboration tool and one of Microsoft's most popular business
                products. Many business people have heard
                about SharePoint but struggle to understand exactly how SharePoint can improve their business processes.
                Decision makers who are interested in
                using SharePoint, can find it hard to find the right information to help them make informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p>A search on Google will provide a lot of technical information on SharePoint 2010, but this information
                can be difficult for a non IT person
                to understand. This webinar presents the features and business case to use SharePoint in terms that all
                business people can understand.</p> <br />
            <p><strong>Webinar Objectives</strong></p>
            <p>This webinar will provide the attendee with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A broad understanding of the SharePoint feature set</li>
                <li>An in depth understanding of how key features of SharePoint can enhance business processes</li>
                <li>An understanding of the costs, timelines, staff involvement and commitment a business will incur
                    when implementing SharePoint</li>
                <li>This webinar is presented in layman terms which staff in all departments can understand.</li>

            <p>Professional Scrum Developer courses teach students how to work in a team, using modern software
                engineering practices, to develop
                an increment of potentially releasable functionality using a specific technology platform. Students
                learn to do so within the Scrum
                framework doing iterative incremental development.</p>
            <p>Classes are exercise-driven, with students working in self-organizing teams to develop “done” increments
                from Product Backlog items. </p>
            <p><strong>Course at a Glance</strong></p>
            <p>This 3-day Professional Scrum Developer .NET course is a mix of lecture, demonstration, group discussion,
                simulation, and hands-on
                software development. The bulk of the course will be spent working as a team on a case study application
                delivering increments of new
                functionality in mini-sprints. Here is the course at a glance:</p>

            <p><strong>Protecting your web apps from the tyranny of evil with OWASP</strong></p>
            <p>Speaker: Troy Hunt</p>
            <p>We’ve all seen the news lately – big guys like Gawker and Sony falling heavily due to serious security
                vulnerabilities in their web
                application designs. </p>
            <p>This session includes a brief intro to the risks web apps face and what OWASP is all about. There are
                then a few minutes on each of
                the OWASP Top 10 web application security risks in terms of both what the risk is (i.e. SQL injection
                allowing execution of unintended
                TSQL) and what the mitigation techniques are (i.e. input parsing, command parameterisation). The
                mitigations will specifically refer to
                facilities provided within ASP.NET.
            <p><strong>ABOUT THE PRESENTER</strong></P>

        <p>
            The Architect's Master Class is a 5 days training, and is the ultimate resource for the professional
            architect. The class is
            conducted in the style of a Master Class, where a Master architect shares his experience and perspective,
            and interacts with
            the students.
        </p>
        <p>
            The class has three parts, on process, technology & SOA, and the IDesign method for analysis and design. The
            class shows the
            architect how to take an active leadership role on all three aspects, as a continuum, since when executing a
            design, one cannot
            separate process from design from technology - all three have to work in concert. While the class shows how
            to design modern
            systems, it sets the focus on the 'why' and the rationale behind particular design decisions, often shedding
            light on poorly
            understood aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will see relevant design guidelines, best practices, and pitfalls, and the crucial process required of
            today's modern
            architects. Don't miss on this unique opportunity to learn and improve your architecture skills with
            IDesign, and share
            their passion for architecture and software engineering.
