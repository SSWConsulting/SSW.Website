  title: SSW Melbourne Directions

aboutUs: >-
  #### SSW Melbourne is our 3rd successfully opened Australian office. With Melbourne being home to more than 
  half of Australia’s top 20 technology companies. Some of Melbourne’s key digital technology strengths 
  include software development, market platforms, cloud technology, and data analytics. These capabilities 
  support Victoria’s continuing emergence as a tech hub. As such, it seemed a logical step to open an office there.

  SSW Consulting has over 30 years of Microsoft software and web development experience. We build on top of 
  Angular, React, Vue, Azure, Azure DevOps (was TFS), SharePoint, Office 365, Blazor, .NET, WebAPI, 
  Dynamics 365, and SQL Server.


  However, the primary focus of the office is native rich client for 
  [desktop](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Desktop-Development.aspx), and [innovative mobile apps 
  (for Android and Apple's iOS)](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Mobile-Application-Development.aspx). 
  We will work with your team to build your mobile application using Xamarin 
  and leveraging it to run on all major mobile platforms, giving you a great return on investment.


  Our team is experienced with creating [HTML5 web applications](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Web-Applications.aspx) 
  that are both desktop & mobile friendly that use the latest web standards such as MVC, WebApi, 
  [Angular](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Angular.aspx), [React](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/React.aspx), 
  and Bootstrap.


  We are also experienced with migrating existing business applications to new platforms, to help your business grow and capture new opportunities.

parking: >-
  The best way to get to SSW Melbourne is via public transport. If you have to drive, parking can be tricky.
  There is a Car Park just a few meters from the SSW office, but it's expensive and we don't recommend it. 
  Rates start at $8 per half hour and go up to $79 for a full day(!). To see a full list of other parking options, 
  visit [carparking.info](https://www.carparking.info/).

publicTransport: >-
  * **Trains:** Nestled between 4 different stations, SSW Melbourne is no more than a 10 minute walk from 
  the train. Depending on where you're coming from, you can get off at Flagstaff, Melbourne Central, 
  Southern Cross, or Flinders Street stations. 

  * **Buses:** The nearest tram stop is Bourke Street mall. Trams that stop there are the 86, 96, 19, 57 
  and 59. For comprehensive information on getting to Hardware Lane, 
  use the [Public Transport Victoria Journey Planner](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/journey).
