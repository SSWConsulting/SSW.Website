aboutUs: >
  **SSW Melbourne is our 3rd successfully opened Australian office. With
  Melbourne being home to more than half of Australia’s top 20 technology
  companies. Some of Melbourne’s key digital technology strengths include
  software development, market platforms, cloud technology, and data analytics.
  These capabilities support Victoria’s continuing emergence as a tech hub. As
  such, it seemed a logical step to open an office there.**


  SSW Consulting has over 30 years of Microsoft software and web development
  experience. We build on top of Angular, React, Vue, Azure, Azure DevOps (was
  TFS), SharePoint, Microsoft 365 (was Office 365), Blazor, .NET, WebAPI,
  Dynamics 365, and SQL Server.


  However, the primary focus of the office is native rich client for
  [desktop](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Desktop-Development.aspx), and
  [innovative mobile apps (for Android and Apple's
  iOS)](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Mobile-Application-Development.aspx).
  We will work with your team to build your mobile application using Xamarin and
  leveraging it to run on all major mobile platforms, giving you a great return
  on investment.


  Our team is experienced with creating [HTML5 web
  applications](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Web-Applications.aspx)
  that are both desktop & mobile friendly that use the latest web standards such
  as MVC, WebApi, [Angular](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Angular.aspx),
  [React](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/React.aspx), and Bootstrap.


  We are also experienced with migrating existing business applications to new
  platforms, to help your business grow and capture new opportunities.

  just a few shops down from the famous restaurants of Hardware Lane.![The
  Hardware Lane](/images/hardwarelane.jpg "The Hardware Lane")
parking: >
  The best way to get to SSW Melbourne is via public transport. If you have to
  drive, parking can be tricky. There is a Car Park just a few meters from the
  SSW office, but it's expensive and we don't recommend it. Rates start at $8
  per half hour and go up to $79 for a full day(!). To see a full list of other
  parking options, visit [carparking.info](https://www.carparking.info/).
publicTransport: >
  * **Trains:** Nestled between 4 different stations, SSW Melbourne is no more
  than a 10 minute walk from the train. Depending on where you're coming from,
  you can get off at Flagstaff, Melbourne Central, Southern Cross, or Flinders
  Street stations.

  * **Buses:** The nearest tram stop is Bourke Street mall. Trams that stop
  there are the 86, 96, 19, 57 and 59. For comprehensive information on getting
  to Hardware Lane, use the [Public Transport Victoria Journey
  Planner](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/journey).
