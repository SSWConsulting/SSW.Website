aboutUs: >
  **SSW Newcastle is our 4th Australian office. We chose Newcastle because of
  its vibrant, enthusiastic, and up-and-coming tech community, as well as the
  presence of a world-class university. Newcastle University is ranked within
  the top 200 in the world and is within in the top 8 in Australia for research.
  With so much potential, and a city-wide commitment to technology and
  digitisation (with the city committing to be a smart and sustainable city by
  2030), it is the perfect place for SSW to continue to grow.**


  The office boasts some of our best [web
  developers](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Web-Applications.aspx) and
  consultants. We have expertise in building responsive websites with ASP.NET
  MVC, [Angular](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Angular.aspx),
  [React](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/React.aspx), and [Microsoft
  Azure](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Azure.aspx) services. With a
  certified Scrum Master and over 20 years of combined experience in the
  industry, our Newcastle Devs have experience in tailoring and delivering the
  best solutions for any project that comes their way. Additionally, our
  developers and designers have a particular interest in mobile and can build
  both mobile-targeted websites as well as [cool mobile apps (for Android and
  Apple's
  iOS)](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Mobile-Application-Development.aspx).


  We count amongst our number some of Australia's best technical presenters, and
  we pride ourselves on our teaching expertise with highly effective trainers.
  We've been instrumental in effecting change with everything from software
  audits to training courses, to hands-on mentoring.

  We have successfully helped many organizations implement Scrum, and we've
  guided many development teams to improve their processes around continuous
  integration, testing, and software architecture. We help teams adopt Agile
  practices using Visual Studio, Team Foundation Server or Visual Studio Online,
  and Microsoft Azure.
