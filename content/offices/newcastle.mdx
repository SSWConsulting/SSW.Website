  title: SSW Newcastle Directions

aboutUs: >
  #### SSW Newcastle is our 4th Australian office. We chose Newcastle because of its 
  vibrant, enthusiastic, and up-and-coming tech community, as well as the presence 
  of a world-class university. Newcastle University is ranked within the top 200 in 
  the world and is within in the top 8 in Australia for research. With so much potential, 
  and a city-wide commitment to technology and digitisation (with the city committing 
  to be a smart and sustainable city by 2030), it is the perfect place for SSW to 
  continue to grow.


  The office boasts some of our best [web developers](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Web-Applications.aspx) 
  and consultants. We have expertise in building responsive websites with ASP.NET 
  MVC, [Angular](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Angular.aspx), 
  [React](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/React.aspx), and 
  [Microsoft Azure](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Azure.aspx) services. 
  With a certified Scrum Master and over 20 years of combined experience in the industry, 
  our Newcastle Devs have experience in tailoring and delivering the best solutions for any 
  project that comes their way. Additionally, our developers and designers have a particular 
  interest in mobile and can build both mobile-targeted websites as well as 
  [cool mobile apps (for Android and Apple's iOS)](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Mobile-Application-Development.aspx).


  We count amongst our number some of Australia's best technical presenters, and we pride ourselves on our teaching expertise with highly effective trainers. We've been instrumental in effecting change with everything fromâ€¯software auditsâ€¯toâ€¯training courses, to hands-onâ€¯mentoring.

  We have successfully helped many organizations implementâ€¯Scrum, and we've guided many development teams to improve their processes aroundâ€¯continuous integration,â€¯testing, andâ€¯software architecture. We help teams adopt Agile practices using Visual Studio, Team Foundation Server or Visual Studio Online, and Microsoft Azure.
