aboutUs: >
  **SSW Brisbane was our 2nd Australian office. It is the home base for some of
  our best [web
  developers](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Web-Applications.aspx) and
  consultants. We are experts in building responsive websites with ASP.NET MVC,
  [Angular](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Angular.aspx),
  [React](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/React.aspx), and [Microsoft
  Azure](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Azure.aspx) services.
  Additionally, our developers and designers are interested in mobile technology
  and can build both mobile-targeted websites, as well as [ingenious mobile apps
  (for Android and Apple's
  iOS)](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Mobile-Application-Development.aspx).**


  The Brisbane office has a number of experts in [application lifecycle
  management](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/alm-tooling), including a
  Microsoft MVP in Application Lifecycle Management. We count amongst our number
  some of [Queensland's best technical
  presenters](https://tv.ssw.com/tag/damian-brady,adam-stephensen,brendan-richards,igor-goldobin/),
  and we pride ourselves on our teaching expertise with highly effective
  trainers. We've been instrumental in effecting change with everything from
  [software audits](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/software-audit) to
  [training courses](https://www.ssw.com.au/events?location=brisbane), to
  [hands-on mentoring](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Mentoring.aspx).


  We have successfully helped many organizations implement
  [Scrum](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Scrum.aspx), and we've guided a
  large number of development teams to improve their processes around
  [continuous
  integration](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-continuous-deployment-with-tfs),
  testing, and [software
  architecture](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-architecture-and-code-review).
  We help teams adopt Agile practices using Visual Studio, Team Foundation
  Server or Visual Studio Online, and Microsoft Azure.

parking: >
  As we're located 10 minutes from Central Station, the best way to get to SSW
  Brisbane is via public transport. If you have to drive, the only nearby
  parking options are paid. There is paid parking in front of our building, but
  spaces are limited. To see a full list of parking options, visit
  [carparking.info](https://www.carparking.info/)

  * **Trains:** SSW Brisbane is only a 10 minute walk from Central Station in
  the heart of the city. To find us, exit through the back of the station onto
  Anzac Square memorial. Exit Anzac Square to the left, onto Adelaide St, and
  then turn right at Macrossan St. The entrance to our office will be on
  Macrossan St, to your right.

  * **Buses:** Dozens of bus routes stop on Adelaide St, but the closest stop is
  Queen St Stop 67, and from there it's only a short walk to our office. For
  comprehensive information on getting to Adelaide Street - including route maps
  and timetables - please visit [translink.com.au](https://translink.com.au/).
