aboutUs: >
  #### SSW Brisbane was our 2nd Australian office. It is the home base for some 
  of our best [web developers](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Web-Applications.aspx)
  and consultants. We are experts in building responsive 
  websites with ASP.NET MVC, [Angular](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Angular.aspx), 
  [React](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/React.aspx), and 
  [Microsoft Azure](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Azure.aspx) services. 
  Additionally, our developers and designers are interested in mobile technology 
  and can build both mobile-targeted websites, as well as [ingenious mobile apps 
  (for Android and Apple's iOS)](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Mobile-Application-Development.aspx).


  The Brisbane office has a number of experts in 
  [application lifecycle management](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/ALM-Azure-DevOps.aspx), 
  including a Microsoft MVP in Application Lifecycle Management. We count amongst our number some of 
  [Queensland's best technical presenters](https://tv.ssw.com/tag/damian-brady,adam-stephensen,brendan-richards,igor-goldobin/), 
  and we pride ourselves on our teaching expertise with highly effective trainers. We've been instrumental 
  in effecting change with everything from [software audits](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Software-Audit.aspx) 
  to [training courses](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Company/Offices/brisbane/ssw/Events/), 
  to [hands-on mentoring](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Mentoring.aspx).


  We have successfully helped many organizations implement [Scrum](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Scrum.aspx), 
  and we've guided a large number of development teams to improve their processes around
  [continuous integration](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-continuous-deployment-with-tfs), 
  testing, and [software architecture](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-architecture-and-code-review). 
  We help teams adopt Agile practices using Visual Studio, Team Foundation Server or Visual Studio Online, and Microsoft Azure.
