  **Sydney is the original home of SSW, and it remains the location of the
  company's head office.**


  SSW began as a one-man company in 1990, run from a home office in Forestville.
  Today, SSW has offices in Sydney,

  The Sydney office houses multiple Microsoft MVPs (Most Valuable
  Professionals), a Microsoft RD (Regional Director—1 of only 9 in Australia),
  and 2 qualified Scrum Masters. All SSW developers undergo training for
  Microsoft qualifications (Microsoft Certified Professional), and are
  passionate experts.
