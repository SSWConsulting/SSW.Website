aboutUs: >
  #### Sydney is the original home of SSW, and it remains the location of the
  company's head office.


  SSW began as a one-man company in 1990, run from a home office in Forestville.
  Today, SSW has offices in Sydney, [Melbourne](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Company/Offices/Melbourne/), 
  [Brisbane](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Company/Offices/Brisbane/), 
  [Newcastle](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Company/Offices/Newcastle/), and 
  [Hangzhou, China](https://ssw.com.cn/) with a total of over 50 employees.


  The Sydney office houses multiple Microsoft MVPs (Most Valuable
  Professionals), a Microsoft RD (Regional Directorâ€”1 of only 9 in Australia),
  and 2 qualified Scrum Masters. All SSW developers undergo training for
  Microsoft qualifications (Microsoft Certified Professional), and are
  passionate experts.


  Additionally, SSW Sydney is home to the multi-media team behind [SSW TV](https://tv.ssw.com/), 
  who deliver engaging, professional, and relevant content both for SSW and our
  clients.
