    ### Sydney is the original home of SSW, and it remains the location of the company's head office.

    SSW began as a one-man company in 1990, run from a home office in Forestville. Today, SSW has 
    offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Newcastle, and Hangzhou, China with a total of over 50 employees.

    The Sydney office houses multiple Microsoft MVPs (Most Valuable Professionals), a Microsoft RD (Regional 
    Director—1 of only 9 in Australia), and 2 qualified Scrum Masters. All SSW developers undergo training for 
    Microsoft qualifications (Microsoft Certified Professional), and are passionate experts.

    Additionally, SSW Sydney is home to the multi-media team behind SSW TV, who deliver engaging, professional, 
    and relevant content both for SSW and our clients.

    We are also experienced with migrating existing business applications to new platforms, to help your business 
    grow and capture new opportunities.
