title: 'Empowering Education: How Microsoft Tools can help educators and students thrive '
subTitle: "<VideoEmbed url=\"https://youtu.be/bO57SyxD_6w\" videoWidth=\"w-full\" removeMargin={true} caption=\"Tanya and Mike discuss how the Microsoft tools can drive better learning outcomes\" />\n\nThe modern school is a complex ecosystem. From classrooms alive with kids to teachers and administrators trying to keep up, there’s a constant challenge to balance operations with delivering the best education. Amid this, one key truth emerges: better visibility into data and smoother processes empower teachers to focus on what matters most; students’ learning.\n\nTanya Leahy, a Senior Consultant, has spent over 16 years bridging the gap between education and technology. With extensive experience in school administration, data management, and Microsoft’s toolset, Tanya’s mission is clear: to simplify school operations and improve learning outcomes.\n\nIn Tanya’s words, “Schools today are time-poor, and no software is perfect. The magic happens when technology fills the gaps.”\n\n### A Deep Understanding of Education\n\nTanya worked in senior administrative roles, supporting leadership teams in schools and managing vast amounts of data. Her years of experience taught her that education isn’t just about teaching—it’s about enabling teachers.\n\n“Education has changed dramatically in recent years,” Tanya reflects. “We have an aging workforce of teachers, many of whom aren’t tech-savvy. They need tools that are intuitive, reliable, and save time, not add complexity. That’s where technology makes the difference.”\n\nTanya recalls countless scenarios where the lack of integrated systems left teachers and administrators struggling. From managing student enrollments to tracking attendance and behavioral data, the burden of juggling multiple systems often fell on already overstretched staff.\n\nBut Tanya didn’t see these challenges as roadblocks; she saw opportunities. Combining her deep knowledge of education with her technical expertise, she began crafting solutions tailored to the specific needs of schools.\n\n### Making Data Work for Schools\n\nOne of Tanya’s favorite tools for schools is Power BI. While many education systems collect data, few use it effectively. For Tanya, the key lies in transforming raw information into actionable insights.\n\n“Data isn’t just numbers on a page,” Tanya explains. “It’s a story, about attendance trends, learning gaps, and even how scheduling impacts student engagement.”\n\nShe shares an example from her own experience: “We used Power BI to analyze attendance patterns and noticed a spike in students leaving early on Mondays. The data showed that back-to-back English and math classes after lunch weren’t working. By rethinking the timetable, we reduced absenteeism and helped students stay engaged.”\n\nFor Tanya, moments like these showcase the power of combining technology with a deep understanding of education. “Every decision we make should support students. That’s the ultimate goal.”\n\n### Building Collaborative Communities\n\nBeyond data analysis, Tanya champions tools like SharePoint to foster collaboration within schools. “Schools thrive when information flows seamlessly,” she says. “But without the right infrastructure, important details get lost, and staff spend hours searching for files.”\n\nTanya remembers working in schools without a centralized intranet. “It was chaos. Teachers relied on shared drives or emailed spreadsheets; systems that weren’t scalable or secure.”\n\nIntroducing SharePoint was a game-changer. With its robust permission settings, teachers could access only the information relevant to their roles, while administrators gained a bird’s-eye view of the school’s operations. “It’s not just about storing documents,” Tanya emphasizes. “It’s about creating a shared space where everyone can work smarter.”\n\n> [\U0001F528 *Do you have consistent SharePoint Sites? *](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/consistent-sharepoint-sites)\n\n### Streamlining with Automation\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles schools face is the sheer volume of manual processes. From approving subject changes to handling incident reports, these tasks can consume valuable time.\n\nTanya recounts a project where she used Power Automate to simplify the subject change process. “Students used to run around the school collecting signatures for paper forms. It was inefficient and prone to errors,” she recalls.\n\nWith automation, approvals were routed digitally, cutting the process down to half a day. “That’s time students can spend learning, not chasing paperwork. It’s a small change with a big impact.”\n\n### A Vision for the Future: AI and Agile\n\nLooking ahead, Tanya is excited about the potential of AI in schools. Microsoft’s Copilot and forthcoming agents promise to revolutionize how schools operate, from drafting reports to creating predictive models for student success. “AI will free up teachers to focus on teaching,” Tanya predicts. “Imagine having a system that identifies struggling students early and suggests interventions. That’s the future.”\n\nBut Tanya knows technology alone isn’t enough. Implementing these tools requires careful planning, and her experience with Agile and Scrum methodologies gives her a unique edge. “Schools are big, complex organizations with many stakeholders,” she explains. “To make change happen, you need clear communication, staged rollouts, and buy-in from everyone involved.”\n\nOne of her proudest achievements was leading a progressive reporting project. “It wasn’t just about configuring software,” she says. “It was about rethinking how we measure and communicate student progress. Change is hard, but when done right, it’s incredibly rewarding.”\n\n\n> [\U0001F528 Do you know your Dataverse AI options?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/dataverse-ai-options)\n\n### Better Tools, Better Outcomes\n\nFor Tanya, the ultimate goal of her work is simple: to give educators the tools they need to succeed. “When teachers have better visibility into their students’ needs, they can teach more effectively. When administrators spend less time on manual tasks, they can focus on supporting their teams. And when schools operate smoothly, students thrive.”\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, Tanya remains optimistic. “We’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible. With the right tools and the right mindset, we can transform education - not just for teachers and administrators but for generations of students to come.\n"
