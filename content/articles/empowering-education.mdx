  The modern school is a complex ecosystem. From classrooms alive with kids to
  teachers and administrators trying to keep up, there’s a constant challenge to
  balance operations with delivering the best education. Amid this, one key
  truth emerges: better visibility into data and smoother processes empower
  teachers to focus on what matters most—students’ learning.


  Tanya Leahy, a Senior Consultant, has spent over 16 years bridging the gap
  between education and technology. With extensive experience in school
  administration, data management, and Microsoft’s toolset, Tanya’s mission is
  clear: to simplify school operations and improve learning outcomes.


  In Tanya’s words, “Schools today are time-poor, and no software is perfect.
  The magic happens when technology fills the gaps.”


  ### A Deep Understanding of Education


  Tanya worked in senior administrative roles, supporting leadership teams in
  schools and managing vast amounts of data. Her years of experience taught her
  that education isn’t just about teaching—it’s about enabling teachers.


  “Education has changed dramatically in recent years,” Tanya reflects. “We have
  an aging workforce of teachers, many of whom aren’t tech-savvy. They need
  tools that are intuitive, reliable, and save time, not add complexity. That’s
  where technology makes the difference.”


  Tanya recalls countless scenarios where the lack of integrated systems left
  teachers and administrators struggling. From managing student enrollments to
  tracking attendance and behavioral data, the burden of juggling multiple
  systems often fell on already overstretched staff.


  But Tanya didn’t see these challenges as roadblocks; she saw opportunities.
  Combining her deep knowledge of education with her technical expertise, she
  began crafting solutions tailored to the specific needs of schools.


  ### Making Data Work for Schools


  One of Tanya’s favorite tools for schools is Power BI. While many education
  systems collect data, few use it effectively. For Tanya, the key lies in
  transforming raw information into actionable insights.


  “Data isn’t just numbers on a page,” Tanya explains. “It’s a story—about
  attendance trends, learning gaps, and even how scheduling impacts student
  engagement.”


  She shares an example from her own experience: “We used Power BI to analyze
  attendance patterns and noticed a spike in students leaving early on Mondays.
  The data showed that back-to-back English and math classes after lunch weren’t
  working. By rethinking the timetable, we reduced absenteeism and helped
  students stay engaged.”


  For Tanya, moments like these showcase the power of combining technology with
  a deep understanding of education. “Every decision we make should support
  students. That’s the ultimate goal.”


  ### Building Collaborative Communities


  Beyond data analysis, Tanya champions tools like SharePoint to foster
  collaboration within schools. “Schools thrive when information flows
  seamlessly,” she says. “But without the right infrastructure, important
  details get lost, and staff spend hours searching for files.”


  Tanya remembers working in schools without a centralized intranet. “It was
  chaos. Teachers relied on shared drives or emailed spreadsheets—systems that
  weren’t scalable or secure.”


  Introducing SharePoint was a game-changer. With its robust permission
  settings, teachers could access only the information relevant to their roles,
  while administrators gained a bird’s-eye view of the school’s operations.
  “It’s not just about storing documents,” Tanya emphasizes. “It’s about
  creating a shared space where everyone can work smarter.”


  ### Streamlining with Automation


  One of the biggest hurdles schools face is the sheer volume of manual
  processes. From approving subject changes to handling incident reports, these
  tasks can consume valuable time.


  Tanya recounts a project where she used Power Automate to simplify the subject
  change process. “Students used to run around the school collecting signatures
  for paper forms. It was inefficient and prone to errors,” she recalls.


  With automation, approvals were routed digitally, cutting the process down to
  half a day. “That’s time students can spend learning, not chasing paperwork.
  It’s a small change with a big impact.”


  ### A Vision for the Future: AI and Agile


  Looking ahead, Tanya is excited about the potential of AI in schools.
  Microsoft’s Copilot and forthcoming agents promise to revolutionize how
  schools operate, from drafting reports to creating predictive models for
  student success. “AI will free up teachers to focus on teaching,” Tanya
  predicts. “Imagine having a system that identifies struggling students early
  and suggests interventions. That’s the future.”


  But Tanya knows technology alone isn’t enough. Implementing these tools
  requires careful planning, and her experience with Agile and Scrum
  methodologies gives her a unique edge. “Schools are big, complex organizations
  with many stakeholders,” she explains. “To make change happen, you need clear
  communication, staged rollouts, and buy-in from everyone involved.”


  One of her proudest achievements was leading a progressive reporting project.
  “It wasn’t just about configuring software,” she says. “It was about
  rethinking how we measure and communicate student progress. Change is hard,
  but when done right, it’s incredibly rewarding.”


  ### Better Tools, Better Outcomes


  For Tanya, the ultimate goal of her work is simple: to give educators the
  tools they need to succeed. “When teachers have better visibility into their
  students’ needs, they can teach more effectively. When administrators spend
  less time on manual tasks, they can focus on supporting their teams. And when
  schools operate smoothly, students thrive.”


  As technology continues to evolve, Tanya remains optimistic. “We’re just
  scratching the surface of what’s possible. With the right tools and the right
  mindset, we can transform education—not just for teachers and administrators
  but for generations of students to come.
