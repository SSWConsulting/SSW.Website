  benefits of upgrading to .net 9" />


  Upgrading your software platform is about more than just adopting the latest
  technology—it’s a strategic business decision that drives efficiency,
  security, and competitive advantage. In today’s fast-paced market, sticking
  with outdated frameworks can be as costly as it is risky. Let’s explore the
  journey towards .NET 9 and understand how this upgrade can bring tangible
  benefits to your business.


  ## A Story of Transformation


  Imagine a development manager in Sydney discussing his team’s hesitation over
  upgrading from a legacy framework. His concern wasn’t unfounded: technical
  debt and the fear of disruption are real. Yet, by choosing to upgrade, his
  organisation not only enhanced its application performance but also reaped
  significant cost savings and opened the door to modern AI capabilities. This
  is the kind of transformative story that many businesses experience when they
  invest in modernisation.


  ## Why Upgrade? Business and Technical Benefits


  ### Enhanced Performance and Cost Savings


  .NET 9 delivers impressive performance gains that can directly impact your
  bottom line:


  * Faster Startups: Applications now launch approximately 15% quicker, meaning
  your users can get to work without delay.

  * Improved Resource Efficiency: With a reduction in memory usage by 8–12% and
  faster JSON processing (up to 35% improvement), you can expect lower cloud
  costs and a smoother user experience.

  * Optimised Web Requests: Kestrel’s improvements translate into web requests
  being processed 20% faster with 25% less latency.


  These technical enhancements often lead to real business savings. For
  instance, one client reported nearly a 20% drop in their Azure spend after
  moving to .NET 9—a clear example of technology investments paying for
  themselves.


  ### Unlocking Advanced AI Capabilities


  In a world where data drives decision-making, .NET 9’s native support for AI
  can be a game changer:


  * Built-In AI Support: Leverage large language models directly within your
  applications.

  * Efficient Data Processing: New tensor types and vector storage make it
  simpler to integrate AI without complex workarounds.


  A real-world example saw a team cut their AI integration code by 60%, which
  not only streamlined their development process but also accelerated their time
  to market. For more on modernising your AI integration and other migration
  benefits, see SSW’s rule [Do you know why to upgrade from .NET Framework to
  the latest .NET?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/why-upgrade-to-latest-dotnet/).


  ### Mitigating Migration Challenges


  Of course, every upgrade comes with its challenges. Here’s how to navigate
  some common issues:


  #### NuGet Dependency Resolution


  A new NuGet dependency resolver might download unexpected packages—this can
  slow your build process. The simple fix is to use the
  RestoreUseLegacyDependencyResolver flag in your MSBuild configuration.
  Although this may temporarily reduce restore speed, it allows you to manage
  your dependencies carefully. For further guidance, check out SSW’s [Rules to
  Better
  Nuget](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-nuget-package-management/)
  rule.


  #### Removing Legacy Technologies


  .NET 9 has bid farewell to the insecure BinaryFormatter. Transitioning to
  modern serializers like System.Text.Json not only improves performance but
  also enhances security. While this might seem daunting at first, many
  businesses find that the upgrade paves the way for cleaner, more maintainable
  code. To see how best to approach this change, read SSW’s [modernisation
  guidance](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/dotnet-upgrade-assistant/).


  #### Fine-Tuning API Changes


  Some adjustments—such as switching to an integer overload for
  TimeSpan.FromSeconds—ensure greater precision in time-sensitive code. These
  small changes help avoid bugs and maintain the integrity of your applications.


  ## A Structured Approach to Migration


  A successful migration is built on careful planning and execution. Consider
  these steps:


  1. Begin with a Proof of Concept:
     Test the new environment on a non-critical application. This helps your team familiarise itself with the new framework features without risking business continuity.
  2. Audit Your Dependencies:
     Use robust tools to identify and update outdated NuGet packages. For a comprehensive approach, refer to SSW’s [Rules to Better Nuget](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-nuget-package-management/) and related content on updating your packages.
  3. Benchmark and Validate:
     Set up performance tests to measure improvements before and after migration. This data not only builds confidence internally but also provides a clear picture of ROI.
  4. Leverage Expert Consultation:
     Sometimes, a guided approach makes all the difference. SSW offers a one-hour free call consultation to help you map out the best upgrade strategy tailored to your business needs. [Book a FREE Initial Meeting](https://www.ssw.com.au) with SSW today.
