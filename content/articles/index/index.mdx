Ever feel like you’re acing every practice session, only to choke when game time arrives? That’s exactly how integration testing can go if you rely solely on mocks. That's why our team relies on containerized resources such as  MSSQL, SMTP4DEV, and Azurite. By running these services in Docker containers, we create an environment that mirrors production closely, catching those hidden bugs before they ever get a chance to surprise you in the real world.
