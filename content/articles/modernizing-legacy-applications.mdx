  You. Yes, you. I see you there, with your old WebForms app running on ye olde
  faithful .NET Framework. This article is for you.


  I am a big believer in the "if it ain't broke; don't fix it" philosophy. Some
  young upstart comes to you one day and spends 30 minutes yelling about how
  your application is now considered legacy and - \*gasp\* - not running on the
  latest tech stack! In the famous words of Jeremy
  Clarkson:![](/images/68747470733a2f2f6d65646961312e74656e6f722e636f6d2f6d2f6e776f4a3442533058485941414141642f6f682d6e6f2d616e797761792e676966.gif)


  So you kick the can down the road. For now. Maybe you'll look at updating it,
  at some as-yet-undefined moment in the future. It's just not high on your
  priority list right now. After all, if it ain't broke; why fix it?


  ## Oh no. My app isn't working anymore


  Chances are, your app doesn't exist as a perfect sphere in a vaccuum. You
  probably integrate with other services/apps/products/whatever. You aren't a
  perfect sphere; there are some rough edges in your system. You aren't in a
  vaccuum; friction with the outside world exists.


  And one day, you'll get the call that some up/downstream service has magically
  stopped working with your app.


  If I were a betting man, I'd put money on you having received one/many emails
  prior to this moment, from an engineer or sysadmin, warning you this was going
  to happen.


  Side note: if you didn't, you should [probably give us a
  call](https://www.ssw.com.au/company/contact-us) to make sure you do get
  notified next time.


  You find out that the outside world has deprecated some feature or function
  that you've been relying on for the last 10 years. Even worse; their
  replacement feature/function isn't compatible with your old tech stack. Oh,
  sure, that new feature has been around for the last few years, but it only
  existed in the SDK that your "legacy" application didn't support.


  So instead of being able to modernize your application at leisure while
  business ticks along, you now have to modernize at breakneck speed while your
  whole system is offline. And as we all know, those upgrades that we have to do
  in a panic always go smoothly, right?


  ## Oh no. My data got stolen


  The typical "security vulnerabilities" bogeyman gets thrown around a lot as
  justification for coughing up dough to work on not-feature-delivery stuff.
  It's an interesting talking point, as it strikes fear into the hearts of 2
  groups of people:


  * Those who are new to the game

  * Those who have already had a data breach


  If you're in neither of those groups, then you've probably heard this
  sky-is-probably-about-to-fall argument many times and have become adept at
  tuning it out. Oh that's just Bob, going on about possible security issues
  again. Yawn.


  Let's just pause a moment, and consider the following:


  * Hackers exist

  * Data is valuable

  * Many, many, many companies much larger than yours are doing everything
  possible to stop aforementioned hackers gaining access to the aforementioned
  booty


  You know what those companies are doing? Releasing new versions! Those new
  versions have - among other things - changes specifically built to stop the
  baddies getting at your goodies.


  You know what your app uses? The old versions! Without those security patches!


  I'm not saying it's inevitable that you're going to get hacked. What I am
  saying, however, is that if it happens, the resignation letter you should be
  expecting is your own. Bob is going to go home that evening and sleep like a
  baby.


  ## Oh no. My engineer(s) quit


  Devs have to keep up with tech, or they become less valuable over time. If
  your company is stuck using an outdated tech stack, your developers don't have
  the opportunity to grow. While your existing tech stack might be "fine" for
  your business, developers won't want to stick around and risk being left
  behind. I've interviewed many developers over the years, and one of the
  questions I ask is "why are you interviewing for this job?", and I often hear
  the reply "I want to work with modern tech. I feel like I'm stagnating where I
  am".


  Sure, there are still devs around who know and love Cobol. But not many.


  ## Oh no. What do I do?


  The first step is accepting that you have a problem. Done that? Great! Now how
  to address the problem.


  SSW have done plenty of .NET migrations, and we make all our battle scars
  available on our [Rules to better .NET
  migrations](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rules-to-better-net8-migrations/). If
  you and your developers want to go it alone, read those rules and start making
  a [migration plan](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/migration-plans/).


  Depending on just how "legacy" your legacy app is, you may run into problems
  with dependencies that simply don't have a modern equivalent. We ran into this
  with one of our internal products, where a CRM SDK didn't have a modern
  alternative. There are a few ways you can overcome this, but the worst case
  scenario is that you isolate and abstract that particular integration point
  and leave it on the old tech, while modernizing the rest of your solution.


  And of course, if you want to throw your hands in the air and make it someone
  else's problem - [we'll do it for
  you.](https://www.ssw.com.au/company/contact-us)


  ## Okay okay. How can I avoid getting into this situation in the first
  place/again?


  If you are constantly refactoring to address tech debt and upgrade your tech
  stack, you can avoid your application ever becoming "legacy" and ending up at
  this sticky situation. That's why SSW recommends dedicating 15-20% of every
  Sprint on [Tech Debt](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/technical-debt/)
