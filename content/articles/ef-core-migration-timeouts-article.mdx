  Working with [Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) in
  large, legacy applications can present unique challenges. One common issue is
  **schema drift,** a divergence between EF Core's internal representation of
  the database schema (the snapshot) and the actual database structure. This can
  lead to migration failures, often manifesting as frustrating timeouts.


  We recently encountered this on a client project *(a large Australian
  insurance company)*, where the database's size and complexity had grown beyond
  the capabilities of standard EF Core migration processes.


  ## Understanding EF Core's Schema Snapshot


  EF Core relies on an internal model, or
  [snapshot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli),
  of your database schema. Every time you run a migration, EF Core compares the
  snapshot to your current schema and generates scripts to bring them in sync.
  However, in legacy systems, this snapshot can become out of sync with the real
  database, a phenomenon known as **schema drift.**


  **This drift can occur due to manual database modifications, incomplete
  deployments, or even subtle differences in how different database systems
  handle schema definitions.** The first signs of trouble are often minor, but
  eventually, they can lead to complete migration failures.


  ## A Case Study in Scale


  On a recent client project, we faced exactly this kind of headache. A legacy
  SQL Server database had grown into a behemoth, clocking in at **over 450
  gigabytes with around 40 tables** storing standard, albeit significant,
  amounts of data.


  The sheer scale meant that even small divergences between the EF Core model
  and the actual database could snowball into minutes-long migrations or abrupt
  timeouts.


  > It's crucial to point out that the complexity of a legacy database isn’t
  just in the total size… it’s in the accumulated, sometimes inconsistent,
  changes over many years that make our day-to-day troubleshooting far more
  challenging.


  ## Diagnosing the Timeouts


  When migrations began timing out, our first step was to play detective and
  identify the bottlenecks. We looked into common suspects: complex
  relationships and large data volumes. While some performance tuning helped,
  the real culprit was the sheer scale of the schema changes needed to realign
  the snapshot with the actual database. Specifically, we had a primary key on
  that gigantic table that was changed from `nvarchar(450)` down to `nvarchar(40)`.
  Dropping the key wasn't just a simple *"Ctrl+Z"* situation, it required
  gracefully removing the entire constraint before updating the key.


  Adding to the challenge, our diagnostic toolkit wasn’t exactly top-notch:
  working with a legacy system meant limited access to modern diagnostic tools.
  Instead of using powerful tools like [SQL Server
  Profiler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sql-server-profiler/sql-server-profiler),
  we relied on basic Windows event logs and EF Core logging on the VM to provide
  hints that we were running into timeout issues. It wasn’t glamorous, but it
  got the job done.

  much logging as possible was crucial for gathering any actionable insights**


  ## The Limits of Abstraction: Why EF Core Wasn’t Enough


  While EF Core abstracts away many of the gritty details of database
  management, this abstraction also means that it sometimes struggles with tasks
  it wasn’t designed for. In our case, the abstraction couldn’t handle the huge
  schema realignment required, especially not in a database this size, and
  certainly not within acceptable time limits.


  > **Our pragmatic solution? crafting Raw SQL Migrations**


  Faced with EF Core's limitations, we rolled up our sleeves and got hands-on
  with raw SQL. This involved meticulously crafting SQL scripts to modify the
  database schema directly, sidestepping EF Core's migration framework. Here's
  how we approached it:


  1. **Deep Schema Understanding:** We first mapped out the existing schema and
  the desired changes in detail. Knowing exactly what needed to be altered was
  crucial.

  2. **Step-by-Step Execution:** Changes were broken down into manageable SQL
  scripts. For instance, altering the primary key involved:


  ![](</images/Louis Test Images/Incident-io-batch/hero/raw_sql.png>)**Figure:
  By taking control with raw SQL, we navigated around EF Core's constraints and
  implemented the necessary changes efficiently. Before executing any script
  like the one above, we made sure the database was backed up, so we could
  always restore it if something went sideways**


  3\. **Maintaining Data Integrity:** Ensuring that these changes didn't disrupt
  the existing data was paramount. This meant validating each step meticulously.


  ## Verification and Risk Mitigation


  Executing raw SQL against a production database carries inherent risks. To
  mitigate these, we implemented a rigorous verification process:


  1. **Comprehensive Backups:** Always start with a full backup. It's your
  safety parachute.

  2. **Staging Environment Testing:** Before hitting production, we ran our
  scripts in a staging environment that mirrored production as closely as
  possible.

  3. **Data Validation Scripts:** Post-migration, we executed scripts to compare
  row counts and verify that constraints and data types were correctly applied.

  4. **Rollback Plan:** In case something went sideways, we had a detailed
  rollback plan ready to restore the database to its previous state.


  ## Long-term Strategies to Prevent Schema Drift


  Of course, a reactive approach is only half the battle. **One of the best
  preventive measures is to stick to one technology for schema management. **In
  other words, if you're modelling your database entirely through EF Core, try
  to resist the temptation to make ad hoc changes directly in the database. This
  helps ensure that all changes are recorded as migrations, maintaining a
  trustworthy history that you can audit if something goes awry later on.


  Adopting stricter change control, automated schema validations, and database
  diff tools can also help catch inconsistencies before they spiral out of
  control.


  ## Wrapping Up


  This project highlighted the importance of understanding the limitations of
  even powerful tools like EF Core. While ORMs offer significant benefits, they
  are not a silver bullet for all database challenges.


  By recognizing the signs of schema drift, diagnosing performance bottlenecks,
  and being prepared to employ alternative solutions like raw SQL when
  necessary, developers can successfully manage even the most complex legacy
  databases.


  The key is to be adaptable and choose the most appropriate approach for the
  specific situation, prioritizing data integrity and system stability.
