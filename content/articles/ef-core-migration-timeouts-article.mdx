title: Conquering EF Core Migration Timeouts in a Legacy Database
subTitle: "![](</images/Louis Test Images/Incident-io-batch/hero/db_schema_drift.jpg>)\n\nWorking with [Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) in large, legacy applications can present unique challenges. One common issue is **schema drift,** a divergence between EF Core's internal representation of the database schema (the snapshot) and the actual database structure. This can lead to migration failures, often manifesting as frustrating timeouts.\n\nWe recently encountered this on a client project *(a large Australian insurance company)*, where the database's size and complexity had grown beyond the capabilities of standard EF Core migration processes.\n\n> *[\U0001F528 Do you know how to migrate from EDMX to EF Core?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/migrate-from-edmx-to-ef-core)*\n\n## Understanding EF Core's Schema Snapshot\n\nEF Core relies on an internal model, or [snapshot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli), of your database schema. Every time you run a migration, EF Core compares the snapshot to your current schema and generates scripts to bring them in sync. However, in legacy systems, this snapshot can become out of sync with the real database, a phenomenon known as **schema drift.**\n\n**This drift can occur due to manual database modifications, incomplete deployments, or even subtle differences in how different database systems handle schema definitions.** The first signs of trouble are often minor, but eventually, they can lead to complete migration failures.\n\n## A Case Study in Scale\n\nOn a recent client project, we faced exactly this kind of headache. A legacy SQL Server database had grown into a behemoth, clocking in at **over 450 gigabytes with around 40 tables** storing standard, albeit significant, amounts of data.\n\nThe sheer scale meant that even small divergences between the EF Core model and the actual database could snowball into minutes-long migrations or abrupt timeouts.\n\n> It's crucial to point out that the complexity of a legacy database isn’t just in the total size… it’s in the accumulated, sometimes inconsistent, changes over many years that make our day-to-day troubleshooting far more challenging.\n\n## Diagnosing the Timeouts\n\nWhen migrations began timing out, our first step was to play detective and identify the bottlenecks. We looked into common suspects: complex relationships and large data volumes. While some performance tuning helped, the real culprit was the sheer scale of the schema changes needed to realign the snapshot with the actual database. Specifically, we had a primary key on that gigantic table that was changed from `nvarchar(450)` down to `nvarchar(40)`. Dropping the key wasn't just a simple *\"Ctrl+Z\"* situation, it required gracefully removing the entire constraint before updating the key.\n\nAdding to the challenge, our diagnostic toolkit wasn’t exactly top-notch: working with a legacy system meant limited access to modern diagnostic tools. Instead of using powerful tools like [SQL Server Profiler](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sql-server-profiler/sql-server-profiler), we relied on basic Windows event logs and EF Core logging on the VM to provide hints that we were running into timeout issues. It wasn’t glamorous, but it got the job done.\n\n![](</images/Louis Test Images/Incident-io-batch/hero/Example of enabling detailed EF Core logging.png>)**Figure: Even with limited tools, enabling as much logging as possible was crucial for gathering any actionable insights**\n\n> **\U0001F528 [Do you optimize your EF Core queries?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/optimize-ef-core-queries)** \n\n## The Limits of Abstraction: Why EF Core Wasn’t Enough\n\nWhile EF Core abstracts away many of the gritty details of database management, this abstraction also means that it sometimes struggles with tasks it wasn’t designed for. In our case, the abstraction couldn’t handle the huge schema realignment required, especially not in a database this size, and certainly not within acceptable time limits.\n\n> **Our pragmatic solution? crafting Raw SQL Migrations**\n\nFaced with EF Core's limitations, we rolled up our sleeves and got hands-on with raw SQL. This involved meticulously crafting SQL scripts to modify the database schema directly, sidestepping EF Core's migration framework. Here's how we approached it:\n\n1. **Deep Schema Understanding:** We first mapped out the existing schema and the desired changes in detail. Knowing exactly what needed to be altered was crucial.\n2. **Step-by-Step Execution:** Changes were broken down into manageable SQL scripts. For instance, altering the primary key involved:\n\n![](</images/Louis Test Images/Incident-io-batch/hero/raw_sql.png>)**Figure: By taking control with raw SQL, we navigated around EF Core's constraints and implemented the necessary changes efficiently. Before executing any script like the one above, we made sure the database was backed up, so we could always restore it if something went sideways**\n\n3\\. **Maintaining Data Integrity:** Ensuring that these changes didn't disrupt the existing data was paramount. This meant validating each step meticulously.\n\n## Verification and Risk Mitigation\n\nExecuting raw SQL against a production database carries inherent risks. To mitigate these, we implemented a rigorous verification process:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Backups:** Always start with a full backup. It's your safety parachute.\n2. **Staging Environment Testing:** Before hitting production, we ran our scripts in a staging environment that mirrored production as closely as possible.\n3. **Data Validation Scripts:** Post-migration, we executed scripts to compare row counts and verify that constraints and data types were correctly applied.\n4. **Rollback Plan:** In case something went sideways, we had a detailed rollback plan ready to restore the database to its previous state.\n\n## Long-term Strategies to Prevent Schema Drift\n\nOf course, a reactive approach is only half the battle. \\*\\*One of the best preventive measures is to stick to one technology for schema management. \\*\\*In other words, if you're modelling your database entirely through EF Core, try to resist the temptation to make ad hoc changes directly in the database. This helps ensure that all changes are recorded as migrations, maintaining a trustworthy history that you can audit if something goes awry later on.\n\nAdopting stricter change control, automated schema validations, and database diff tools can also help catch inconsistencies before they spiral out of control.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nThis project highlighted the importance of understanding the limitations of even powerful tools like EF Core. While ORMs offer significant benefits, they are not a silver bullet for all database challenges.\n\nBy recognizing the signs of schema drift, diagnosing performance bottlenecks, and being prepared to employ alternative solutions like raw SQL when necessary, developers can successfully manage even the most complex legacy databases.\n\nThe key is to be adaptable and choose the most appropriate approach for the specific situation, prioritizing data integrity and system stability.\n"
