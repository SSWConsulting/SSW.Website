Every month, SSW hosts the Brisbane Full Stack User Group, where developers come together to learn about the latest technologies from local and internationally renowned experts. Topics focus on .NET and other Microsoft technologies (Azure, DevOps, SharePoint, Power Platform, and more), full stack development (Angular, React, Blazor), and mobile apps with .NET MAUI (was Xamarin), as well as exciting opportunities to learn about the latest industry trends and even tips on presenting from world class speakers.
