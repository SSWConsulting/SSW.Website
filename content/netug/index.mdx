# SSW User Groups

Every month SSW hosts the Sydney .NET User Group, where developers come together to learn about the latest technologies from local and internationally renowned experts. Topics focus on .NET and other Microsoft technologies (Azure, DevOps, SharePoint, .NET MAUI (previously Xamarin), GitHub and more), full stack development (Angular, React, Blazor and more), as well as exciting opportunities to learn about the latest industry trends and even tips on presenting from world class speakers.
