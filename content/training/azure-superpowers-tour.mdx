      Part 3: Data


      Azure has many different types of Storage services. We will show you how
      you can serve your data from Azure to be globally accessible and able to
      perform under high read & write loads.


      You will learn about:


      * Azure Storage (Blob, File, Table, Queue)

      * Azure SQL Server

      * Azure CosmosDB


      Part 4: Azure AD B2C


      Using Azure Active Directory B2C (Business to Consumer) you can connect
      customers from around the globe to your application. We will show you how
      to securely connect your customers to your application using industry
      standard protocols to make identity management easy.


      You will learn about:


      * Azure AD B2C

      * Branded Sign-up and Sign-in Experiences

      * Connect via Social Networks

      * Enable Multifactor Authentication

      anywhere, and expose it through a modern API gateway.


      You will learn about:


      * Azure API Management

      * Publish your existing APIs for consumers

      Part 6: Logic Apps


      Azure Logic Apps are used to automate business processes, complete tasks
      and orchestrate workflows. They are especially powerful when you are
      integrating with other applications, data sources and services.


      We will show you how to build a scalable integration solution that uses
      some of the available connectors to securely access and process data in
      real-time.

      speak using:


      * Face Recognition

      * Text Analytics


      Part 8: Bots


      Bots are front and centre of Application Modernization. Your employees
      demand to be empowered and they want to find information and if they are
      Gen-Y they don't want to have a conversation with anyone except a Bot.
      Many companies are finding that their Corporate Bots are quickly taking
      over the way users interact with their applications.

      microservices. In this section we will walk you through how we build
      scalable and maintainable enterprise applications using Docker and Azure
      Kubernetes Services.
