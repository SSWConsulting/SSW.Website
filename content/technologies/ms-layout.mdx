Microsoft Layout is a VR application developed by Microsoft. It brings designs from concept to completion with confidence and speed. Microsoft Layout imports 3D models to easily create room layouts in real-world scale and allows you to experience designs as high-quality holograms in physical space or virtual reality and edit with stakeholders in real time.
