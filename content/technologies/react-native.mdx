## React Native

React Native provides an environment where developers can build native mobile applications using JavaScript. Instead of keeping users waiting for endless recompiling, React Native can reload applications instantly, helping developers to build much faster apps. Meanwhile, React Native works smoothly with components written in Java, Objective-C, and Swift.
