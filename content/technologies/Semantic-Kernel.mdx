Semantic Kernel is a cutting-edge tool that is central to an AI Copilot system. It allows developers to combine custom software with existing AI models like ChatGPT and Midjourney to orchestrate autonomous workflows. It enables AI development to be flexible, with connectors and plugins as the "brain" and functions to interact with the real world as the "body" of an app.
