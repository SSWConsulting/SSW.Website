This lightweight tool enables developers to integrate AI models and plugins, creating new user experiences. Whether orchestrating plugins for ChatGPT, Bing, Microsoft 365 Copilot, or other models, Semantic Kernel offers a flexible approach to AI development with connectors, plugins, and extensibility. Its strategic implementation in orchestrating complex tasks, from planning to memory storage, enhances the development process, making it an invaluable asset for enterprise app developers.
