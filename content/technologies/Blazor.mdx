Blazor is a .NET-based framework developed and maintained by Microsoft that enables developers to build interactive and highly responsive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. It offers the flexibility to develop applications for various deployment targets - web, mobile web, and even potentially native mobile or desktop environments, using the same language and tools across all platforms.
