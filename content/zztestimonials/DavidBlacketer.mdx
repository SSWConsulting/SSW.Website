As we are now 20 plus weeks into our projects with yourselves I wanted to express that I am very happy with the team's productivity and everyone's participation but especially impressed with Jean, Kosta and Matt Wicks.
Jean's management is very much on point, prompt, detailed, decisive change management, and outcome focused which is a lot of comfort to me as my time investment capability is minimal but appropriate for the project successful delivery.
The interaction and engagement across our organisations is also working well, efficient, collaborative and all things good that I want in a well-run and successful development project.
Complements aside, as I have discussed with Jean, I am looking forward to continuing our engagement with this team on 3 follow-on projects already approved and a fourth likely to be aproved before Jan 2021, thanks!
