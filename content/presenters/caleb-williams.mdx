about: >-
  Caleb has proficiencies with .NET, SQL Server, MySQL and EF Core, but he
  primarily stands out as a **front end developer**. He has skills integrating
  websites with both React and Angular, including a proven ability to develop
  performant websites with server components using Next.js. This combination of
  skills means that Caleb excels at configuring performat React projects with
  external dependencies, including React projects leveraging
  [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/about).

  Toward the end of his degree, Caleb undertook a full-time 5-month [coding
  bootcamp](https://firebootcamp.com/). This pivotal experience not only
  improved his coding abilities, but also refined his communication skills and
  gave him a respect for the core tenets of Scrum in a practical environment
  which he later demonstrated by becoming a **certified Scrum Master**. He
  learned the value of being transparent with stakeholders, communicative with
  his team, and respectful of the product owner's vision throughout the software
  development process.
