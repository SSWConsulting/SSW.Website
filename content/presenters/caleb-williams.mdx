  Caleb is a skilled software developer with expertise in .NET, SQL Server,
  MySQL, and EF Core. However, his true strengths lie in front-end development.
  He specializes in integrating React and Next.js applications and has a proven
  ability to build high-performance server-component-based websites using
  Next.js. His deep understanding of the React ecosystem and server side
  rendering are indespensible assets Caleb leverages when integrating TinaCMS
  into performat SEO friendly React applications.

  Toward the end of his degree, Caleb undertook a full-time, five-month coding
  bootcamp, which significantly enhanced both his technical and communication
  skills. This experience deepened his appreciation for Scrum principles, which
  he later formalized by earning his Scrum Master certification. Caleb
  prioritizes transparency with stakeholders via effective team communication,
  and alignment with the product owner’s vision to drive successful project
  outcomes.
