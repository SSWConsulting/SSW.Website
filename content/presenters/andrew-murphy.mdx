about: >
  Originally from the UK but now based in Melbourne, Andrew started out as a
  software developer and has been writing code for over 22 years, but this isn't
  what he is the most proud of. As a pseudo-extrovert, Andrew would never have
  dreamt of standing in front of people, on a stage, delivering workshops,
  keynote speeches and presentations. Andrew talks about topics he's passionate
  about, shares experiences and teaches the skills that software managers, tech
  leads, consultants and heads of departments need to succeed as leaders in
  technology. As a technical leadership coach, Andrew also enjoys mentoring
  other people to help them navigate the path of leadership in the technical
  world so that they get the success they want in their careers.
