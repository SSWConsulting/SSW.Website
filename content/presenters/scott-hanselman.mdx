about: >
  â€‹Scott Hanselman is the Partner Program Manager at Microsoft.

  I'm a teacher. I speak all over to whoever will listen. I have written code
  that you've used. I've been blogging for over a decade, coding for twice that,
  and podcasting for over half that. I code, write, speak, empower, promote,
  braid, learn and listen - usually not in that order.
