about: >-
  Hugo isn't your typical SSW Solution Architect and Local Manager; he's a
  seasoned professional with over a decade of hands-on experience in Angular and
  .NET Core.

  Beyond the coding screen, Hugo has another passion: music. You might catch him
  strumming his guitar during downtime, adding a touch of rhythm to his
  tech-savvy life.
