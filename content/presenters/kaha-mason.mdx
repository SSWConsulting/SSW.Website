about: >-
  As a Software Engineer and consultant at SSW, I help businesses turn complex
  challenges into elegant, reliable software solutions. With over 6 years of
  experience in software development, I’ve helped to deliver enterprise systems
  and custom applications that improve efficiency, reduce costs, and tackle many
  of the new challenges facing businesses today.

  I specialize in the .NET development stack, creating secure, scalable, and
  high-performance solutions. I work closely with clients to understand their
  goals and needs to design and implement software that not only meets
  requirements but also adapts to future challenges.
