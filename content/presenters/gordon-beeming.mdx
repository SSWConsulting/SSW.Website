  He's uber passionate about helping people really understand DevOps and how
  they approach their problems with a DevOps mindset.

  He's used the Microsoft stack for many years starting with .net 2.0 in 2008.
  He's worked with Azure DevOps since the early on-premises TFS days and used
  the cloud version since available as tfpreview.

  He's co-authored many guidance docs as part of the ALM Rangers, written 2
  books on Customization TFS and a co-authored of Managing Agile Open-Source
  Software Projects with Visual Studio Online (now Azure DevOps Services).

  When he's not pushing technology limits you'll find him training for the next
  swim/bike/run event or relaxing with his family.
