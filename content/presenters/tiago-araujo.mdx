about: >-
  Tiago is our favourite creative genius. When he told us he was moving from
  Australia, we said: _"OK, but you're still working remotely for us"_. We
  couldn't let him go. This was 10+ years before the pandemic, so we are proud
  to say Tiago is a trailblazer in the realm of remote work. After a few years
  in Brazil, he now lives and works in the west coast of Canada.  

  With 15+ years experience working as a designer for both print and web
  projects, he loves spending time designing in Figma or writing clean HTML/CSS
  for websites and apps... while listening to old songs. Tiago has developed
  responsive websites and apps ranging from concept, layout, mark-up,
  implementation, testing, and maintenance.
