about: >
  â€‹Hacker, tinkerer, car modder and "the dog guy", Alexei has been in the
  offensive security space for over 10 years.

  From hacking into networks and applications, to gaining physical access into
  buildings, Alexei specialises in breaking into thing. He runs a company called
  Volkis and wants to keep the old school hacker culture alive (think Hackers,
  the movie).
