about: >
  He loves DevOps, DevOps, and DevOps. These days he prefers GitHub Actions and
  Azure DevOps Build Pipelines over Octopus and Bamboo. Matt likes clean
  architecture, using the right tool for the job, seeing developers push changes
  to production with confidence, automated tests, building solutions on Azure,
  and now he never has to reminisce about Webforms.
