about: >-
  As the Chief Property Officer at SSW, I am committed to ensuring that every
  aspect of our property management—ranging from routine maintenance and urgent
  repairs to planned upgrades and strategic relocations—is handled with
  precision and efficiency. My role involves overseeing all property-related
  matters across our offices, including periodic site visits to stay attuned to
  the needs of each location.

  With a robust background in project management, estimation, supervision,
  negotiations, and quality control, I am adept at navigating the complexities
  of construction and maintenance projects. Whether dealing with straightforward
  tasks or intricate, time-consuming projects, my focus is always on preemptive
  planning and safeguarding SSW’s interests to deliver optimal outcomes.
