  ## Overview

  As the CPO it is my intention to be across all property matters for all
  offices – whether that be scheduled maintenance, urgent repairs, planned
  upgrades, and / or designed relocations or expansions.  I would envisage
  visiting and checking in on all our offices periodically over time. As is the
  nature of construction and maintenance, some projects will be small easy fast
  and seamless, and some will be larger more complex, time consuming, and
  annoying to staff. Whichever the path, I will always attempt to be in front of
  the process and demand SSW interests prevail.
