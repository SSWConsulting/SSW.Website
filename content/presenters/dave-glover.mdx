about: >
  â€‹I am a passionate software developer for as long as I can remember, I dream
  and code in C%23 and Python, hang out on Windows and Linux, and dabble in
  maker hardware. I have worked for Microsoft in the UK and Australia across
  customers, partners and the developer community. Over the years I have covered
  a broad range of technologies, from Windows and mobile, Web dev, IoT,
  communications, and cloud-centric computing. I am curious by nature, love to
  learn and connect with the developer community.

  When not coding, I am a proud father of 3 and live in the heart of beautiful
  Sydney Australia with my husband and youngest son. I swim to keep fit and can
  be bribed with ice cream.
