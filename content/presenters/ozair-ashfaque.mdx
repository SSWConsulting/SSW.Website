about: >-
  Ozair is an innovative SSW Software Developer based in the Melbourne office,
  known for his unique blend of technical prowess and problem-solving skills.
  Holding a Master's in Network Systems with a specialization in Cyber Security
  from Swinburne University, he excels in both front-end and back-end
  development, with a particular focus on Angular, React, and .NET technologies.

  In a recent challenge, Ozair and his team were tasked with migrating a
  large-scale project from .NET Framework to .NET 8. They wanted to avoid a
  feature freeze and reduce risk by ensuring old parts of the app were retired
  as soon as possible. To accomplish this feat, they utilized a reverse proxy
  (YARP) to run both versions in tandem, allowing for a seamless transition and
  immediate use of new features.
