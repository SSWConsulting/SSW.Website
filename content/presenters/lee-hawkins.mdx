about: >-
  In the IT industry since 1996 in both development and testing roles, Lee has
  spent most of his career helping software development teams across the world
  to improve the way they build, test and deliver software. He is a seasoned
  practitioner, author and presenter in the worldwide testing community.

  Software quality remains a critical issue for project success yet modern
  testing & quality practices rarely seem to be adopted well to focus on
  delivering great quality products. Lee's collaborative approach and
  craftsmanship mindset to software testing result in test strategies and
  approaches that genuinely help to improve the quality of your software.
