about: >-
  ✨ A true Full-stack developer, working across a broad range of technologies
  from your nuts-and-bolts Web Development with Angular & React, to
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) DevOps via Terraform, to Embedded Devices with
  Raspberry Pi and Docker. Sam loves tackling new technologies and finding the
  right tool for the job.

  ♟️ Highly social developer and an enthusiastic problem solver, who loves
  nothing more than being part of the discussion and working directly with
  clients to find the optimal solution. Just as comfortable leading a project as
  he is working in the trenches, always ready for a challenge.
