about: >-
  As a Senior Accountant at SSW with over 7 years of experience, I thrive at the
  intersection of financial expertise and technology, tackling complex
  challenges with innovative solutions. Collaborating closely with our Financial
  Controller, I ensure the seamless operation of our financial systems through
  accurate reporting, efficient process management, and strategic planning. 

  My career has been defined by driving efficiency and delivering results. By
  implementing advanced automation tools like Xero, I have streamlined
  workflows, improved reporting accuracy, and empowered data-driven
  decision-making. My approach to management accounting focuses on actionable
  insights that support growth and long-term success.
