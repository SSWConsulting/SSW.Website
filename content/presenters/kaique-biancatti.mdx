  Kiki is one of those rare SysAdmins who is a Powershell Guru. He has been a
  Systems Analyst at SSW for many years, and he has taken some of our processes
  from horse and carriage to more Tesla-like. He has supercharged SSW clients
  using PowerShell, Power Apps, Power Automate (was Microsoft Flow) and
  Zendesk. 

  He has a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and many years of experience
  working as a Customer Experience Analyst before tackling greater things,
  giving him the necessary skill-set to give SSW clients the best possible
  customer service and support.
