          with cancer.  Mammography is the primary diagnostic tool for detecting
          breast cancer  with 800,000 women X-rayed annually in Australia;
          however, it fails to  detect 30% of breast cancers, with many missed

          Many websites are needed for the Institute, with websites for the
          brand,  international versions, and microsites for subdivisions.


          The websites require a lot of maintenance and constant content
          changes.  Prior to SSW developing the Sitefinity solution, this was
          all done  manually within a small IT team.


          A CMS was desperately needed to allow subdivisions to update their
          sites  and content directly (with an approval workflow).

        logo: /images/Clients/commbank-logo.png
        content: >
          CBA is one of Australia's largest banks, and it employs thousands of 
          people Australia wide. SSW developed an intranet based ASP.NET
          solution  to help them better manage their staffing timesheets and
          allow HR to  better track employee performance and work expectations.


          The project was written in .NET with a MS SQL Server backend. It was 
          written in a combination of both VB.NET (for the front-end plus
          security)  and C# (for data access and business logic). The website
          needed to be  very rich in terms of the client interaction, it was
          originally slated  as a Windows Forms project but for various reasons
          it ended up being web  based. This meant that large effort was put
          into developing and using  rich controls with considerable client-side
          functionality.


          An interesting challenge of this project involved the security
          implementation,  whereby the system had to not only allow integrated
          (Windows) if possible  to allow users to be identified without needing
          to enter a sign in prompt, but it also had to share its authentication 
          and authorization logic with any number of external applications. This 
          means that the authentication and authorization process talks to up to 
          3 different web services in order to log a user in.


          Implementing the database schema also threw up a number of challenges 
          including an interesting modeling of the organizational hierarchy and 
          our ability to efficiently query parent-child and parent-descendent 
          relationships within the self-referencing data.


          The CommTrack application is now expected to serve some thousands of 
          internal users throughout their day and feed into a greater data 
          warehouse to enable advanced management reporting. It is a massive 
          improvement over an existing system of manual spreadsheet
          maintenance.  When the full rollout is complete, CommTrack is expected
          to give CBA  nvestment returns in the range hundreds of thousands of
          dollars per  year through increased staff productivity and process
          improvements.


          <ContentCard
            content={<>
              A quick note to say thanks for all the work on CommTrack and support for the implementation. The app is getting very good reviews from the user base and we have a queue of people lined up nationally wanting to get on and use it. Your part of the larger project has progressed very well (in contrast to roadblocks and pain elsewhere). I wanted to make sure you knew that I recognized a job well done by the SSW and CBA folks.

        content: >
          The NRMA organization provides a Community Grants Program annually, 
          and when the NRMA came to SSW the records in a legacy database were 
          difficult to report on and maintain. One of the key issues faced by 
          the NRMA community grants team was keeping the records of organizations 
          consistent across several years, when it is common for office bearers 
          to change, and for each organization to create separate registrations 
          making reporting difficult if not impossible for periods beyond the 
          current year.


          The solution provided by SSW comprised a custom website written in 
          Microsoft ASP.NET Dynamic Data and with an SQL Server backend. 
          Reporting was built on top of Microsoft Reporting Services. A key 
          feature of the system was a mechanism to identify "re-registration" 
          events when someone tries to register for an organization that is 
          already in the system.


          NRMA now have a secure database for recording the community grants 
          data which is easier to use and maintain that the old system. This 
          system incorporates a mechanism that avoids most cases of organization 
          duplication, and so reporting is reliable across multiple years for 
          the same organization. NRMA have successfully used the system for the 
          first year of its operation, and are looking forward to using it for 
          the next and subsequent years.


          We used these technologies: Microsoft ASP.NET Dynamic Data, SQL 
          Server, and Microsoft Reporting Services.

          capabilities. As part of their ongoing effort in improving efficiency 
          and productivity, several legacy spreadsheets and reports need to be 
          converted into web applications. To ensure consistency, a common visual 
          framework is required across applications.


          SSW worked together with LendLease IT department and together formed 
          a series of visual UI framework which are used for existing and future 
          web applications.


          With the visual framework in place, developers can focus their effort

          look. End users also benefit from having a common UI theme across their

          The organization was formed to build a series of large water resource 
          projects to provide adequate water resources to South East Queensland. 
          In each of those projects a large amount of land was needed making the 
          acquisition, recording, contracts and communication and key element, and 
          even before a project started a large number of documents are generated 
          relating to site planning, images, email, agreements, and other documents. 
          Queensland Water Infrastructure needed a solution to handle the volume 
          and change management in all this data.


          SSW provided a solution as two key systems, 1) tracking and reporting 
          on the land acquisitions, and 2) a document management system. A custom 
          application was written to track the acquisitions. This system had a 
          Microsoft SQL Database backend, allowing the complex reporting requirements 
          to be satisfied by Microsoft Reporting Services. The management of 
          documents was built on top of Microsoft SharePoint and WISDOM DMF. 
          The features of Enterprise SharePoint were extended with custom WebParts 
          for project navigation, and custom context menus with options available 
          based on the type of document stored.


          Projects of the size involved have many legal and practical management 
          requirements that only a system that is both reliable and performing 
          the core business model can provide. The systems SSW provided were 
          tailored to the exact model that QWI ran its business on, and the 
          systems have used to complete 3 successful projects, with further 
          project work currently underway.

          SnackBrands were rapidly growing and acquiring other companies. As 
          such they had sales data in many different systems. They were currently 
          reporting my manually consolidating figures into excel and crunching 
          the numbers.


          SSW developed the glue that brought all these systems together using 
          SSIS to grab and dump the data into a data warehouse. We worked with 
          the business users to build a cube off that data that helped report 
          on sales, trends, forecasting, volumes, logistics and customers. We 
          also setup SnackBrand's SharePoint infrastructure configuring Excel 
          services and Reporting Services integration, allowing users to easily 
          query the cube and upload and share reports.


          Empowered users to create their own reports, streamlined their 
          reporting solution by removing the manual steps.


          We used these technologies: SharePoint 2007 MOSS, Reporting Services 
          2008, SQL Server 2008, SSIS, and Excel Services

          eMove is a free online service for finding removalist quotes; utility 
          connections/disconnections; address changes; cleaners; storage; 
          packing and much more.


          SSW was brought into the project to provide new functionality for the 
          removalist quotes and utility connections/disconnections. SSW created 
          2 new DotNetNuke modules for the site and integrated into their solution 
          and bug fixing existing errors on their existing site. SSW was also 
          commissioned to take a new design from eMove and create and implement 
          a DotNetNuke skin for the new design.

          Maximus International is a boutique organizational assessment and 
          development consultancy that offers commercially savvy, unique solutions 
          to business. To support their business they needed a HRIS web application 
          to help manage the HR Process, from initial selection and interviews to 
          staff training and performance reviews. SSW was chosen from a pool of 12 
          development houses to produce this application based on ASP.NET 2.0, AJAX 
          and NHibernate technologies.

          Vulcan Steel approached SSW about a Windows application that needed to be updated to the latest technologies to ensure easier maintainability and reusability. This app is the backbone of Vulcan Steel’s day-to-day business operations.


          They had a desire for a better architecture to allow changes to be made quicker, with a lower chance of unintended defects. With an app of this magnitude, it is essential to keep it up-to-date and functioning perfectly, to ensure a lower total cost of ownership.


          Because this app is so vital, it was also a requirement that the app remain up and running during the process of upgrading it to the new architecture. The challenges didn’t stop there though: All of the logic was embedded in the windows app with no service layer, and Vulcan Steel’s IT people are based in New Zealand whilst SSW are in Australia.

          FastAs provides a global directory of contact information and integrated messaging services for individuals and businesses. It offers free alphabetic and phonetic searching of millions of subscriber listings, and incorporates message forwarding capabilities that enable a subscriber to be contacted without disclosure of the contact details. The FastAs application incorporates on-line processing of both payments and receipting, and offers convenient (and, if necessary, confidential) contact services via Email, SMS, Fax, surface mail and telegram.


          FastAs has no in-house development expertise and, after careful evaluation, selected SSW to complete the development and deployment of their Internet services. Key considerations were SSW's strong project management disciplines, their design and creative talents, and their considerable technical expertise in .NET3.

          Upgrading a complex Access-based application to the latest technologies. The main problem with Access was client deployment issues.


          We are bringing the Access application forward to Silverlight with RIA services. We’re keeping the database schema unchanged so that the new version will run in parallel to their existing application, and gradually phase the old one out. This also allows us to deploy the new version earlier and get the end-users excited.


          Deployment model will be a lot simpler for end-user machines since they won’t need to have Access installed. This will allow Conquest to reach a broader market, and simplify the deployment experience.


          We used these technologies: Silverlight 3 WCF Services RIA services SQL Server ASP.NET.
