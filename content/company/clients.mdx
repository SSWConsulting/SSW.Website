          High quality breast imaging and accurate image assessment are
          critical  to the early diagnoses, treatment and management of women
          with cancer.  Mammography is the primary diagnostic tool for detecting
          breast cancer  with 800,000 women X-rayed annually in Australia;
          however, it fails to  detect 30% of breast cancers, with many missed
          cancers being visible on  the image. SSW build the training platform
          for BreastScreen Reader  Assessment Strategy (BREAST), which monitors
          mistakes, identifies  reasons for mammographic errors and creates
          innovative solutions to  reduce errors. Watch the Case Study video:

          help clients  manage their tax obligations in an automated fashion.
          The initial scope  of the application was to service the Australian
          market with the intention  to expand to other markets globally.

          It has grown to cater for tax obligations in Australia, New Zealand,
          Canada, Switzerland, United Kingdom, India, Singapore, Mexico and
          other European countries and has been successfully deployed to over 50
          large organizations.

          Bupa's agents handle hundreds of insurance claim cases every day. They
          used to use Excel to connect to their database to track and update
          those claim cases, which is slow, crashed easily, no security
          restriction and not user friendly.

          SSW created a user friendly interface for agents to manage cases  more
          efficiently. We integrated with their existing membership  database
          and built the system with case status workflow logic at  the backend.

          The Northern Sydney Institute, part of TAFE NSW, is one of
          Australiaâ€™s  leading providers of vocational training and tertiary
          education.


          Many websites are needed for the Institute, with websites for the
          brand,  international versions, and microsites for subdivisions.


          The websites require a lot of maintenance and constant content
          changes.  Prior to SSW developing the Sitefinity solution, this was
          all done  manually within a small IT team.


          A CMS was desperately needed to allow subdivisions to update their
          sites  and content directly (with an approval workflow).

          CBA is one of Australia's largest banks, and it employs thousands of
          people Australia wide. SSW developed an intranet based ASP.NET
          solution  to help them better manage their staffing timesheets and
          allow HR to  better track employee performance and work expectations.


          The project was written in .NET with a MS SQL Server backend. It was
          written in a combination of both VB.NET (for the front-end plus
          security)  and C# (for data access and business logic). The website
          needed to be  very rich in terms of the client interaction, it was
          originally slated  as a Windows Forms project but for various reasons
          it ended up being web  based. This meant that large effort was put
          into developing and using  rich controls with considerable client-side
          functionality.


          An interesting challenge of this project involved the security
          implementation,  whereby the system had to not only allow integrated
          (Windows) if possible  to allow users to be identified without needing
          to enter a sign in prompt, but it also had to share its
          authentication  and authorization logic with any number of external
          applications. This  means that the authentication and authorization
          process talks to up to  3 different web services in order to log a
          user in.


          Implementing the database schema also threw up a number of challenges
          including an interesting modeling of the organizational hierarchy and
          our ability to efficiently query parent-child and parent-descendent
          relationships within the self-referencing data.


          The CommTrack application is now expected to serve some thousands of
          internal users throughout their day and feed into a greater data
          warehouse to enable advanced management reporting. It is a massive
          improvement over an existing system of manual spreadsheet
          maintenance.  When the full rollout is complete, CommTrack is expected
          to give CBA  nvestment returns in the range hundreds of thousands of
          dollars per  year through increased staff productivity and process
          improvements.


          <ContentCard
            content={<>
              A quick note to say thanks for all the work on CommTrack and support for the implementation. The app is getting very good reviews from the user base and we have a queue of people lined up nationally wanting to get on and use it. Your part of the larger project has progressed very well (in contrast to roadblocks and pain elsewhere). I wanted to make sure you knew that I recognized a job well done by the SSW and CBA folks.

        content: >
          The NRMA organization provides a Community Grants Program annually,
          and when the NRMA came to SSW the records in a legacy database were
          difficult to report on and maintain. One of the key issues faced by
          the NRMA community grants team was keeping the records of
          organizations  consistent across several years, when it is common for
          office bearers  to change, and for each organization to create
          separate registrations  making reporting difficult if not impossible
          for periods beyond the  current year.


          The solution provided by SSW comprised a custom website written in
          Microsoft ASP.NET Dynamic Data and with an SQL Server backend.
          Reporting was built on top of Microsoft Reporting Services. A key
          feature of the system was a mechanism to identify "re-registration"
          events when someone tries to register for an organization that is
          already in the system.


          NRMA now have a secure database for recording the community grants
          data which is easier to use and maintain that the old system. This
          system incorporates a mechanism that avoids most cases of
          organization  duplication, and so reporting is reliable across
          multiple years for  the same organization. NRMA have successfully used
          the system for the  first year of its operation, and are looking
          forward to using it for  the next and subsequent years.


          We used these technologies: Microsoft ASP.NET Dynamic Data, SQL
          Server, and Microsoft Reporting Services.

          project and construction management and asset and property management
          capabilities. As part of their ongoing effort in improving efficiency
          and productivity, several legacy spreadsheets and reports need to be
          converted into web applications. To ensure consistency, a common
          visual  framework is required across applications.


          SSW worked together with LendLease IT department and together formed a
          series of visual UI framework which are used for existing and future
          web applications.


          With the visual framework in place, developers can focus their effort
          in meeting functional requirements and worry less on how the apps
          should  look. End users also benefit from having a common UI theme
          across their  line-of-business applications.

          Microsoft Australia approached SSW to develop a website in
          preparation  for the upcoming 2008 Forum event for SharePoint and
          Office. SSW  delivered a Web 2.0 site build in SharePoint 2007 in less
          than 3 weeks.  The site capitalizes on many of SharePoint's web
          publishing features  and uses jQuery throughout to enhance the user
          experience. Virtual  Earth was integrated to provide venue
          information. The completed site  demonstrates that the possibilities
          of using SharePoint 2007 for a  public facing website are boundless!

          SharePoint 2007 was implemented extensively across their
          organization,  but they were looking to extend the development to
          include their new  public website. After a lengthy tendering process,
          WorleyParsons chose  SSW to develop their new public website and it is
          now powered by SharePoint 2007.


          The site and all components were to be reusable, so site templates,
          page  layouts, content types and web parts were used extensively. This
          allows  WorleyParsons employees with sufficient permissions to manage
          and maintain  the website without requiring any assistance from
          developers.

        content: >
          The organization was formed to build a series of large water resource
          projects to provide adequate water resources to South East
          Queensland.  In each of those projects a large amount of land was
          needed making the  acquisition, recording, contracts and communication
          and key element, and  even before a project started a large number of
          documents are generated  relating to site planning, images, email,
          agreements, and other documents.  Queensland Water Infrastructure
          needed a solution to handle the volume  and change management in all
          this data.


          SSW provided a solution as two key systems, 1) tracking and reporting
          on the land acquisitions, and 2) a document management system. A
          custom  application was written to track the acquisitions. This system
          had a  Microsoft SQL Database backend, allowing the complex reporting
          requirements  to be satisfied by Microsoft Reporting Services. The
          management of  documents was built on top of Microsoft SharePoint and
          WISDOM DMF.  The features of Enterprise SharePoint were extended with
          custom WebParts  for project navigation, and custom context menus with
          options available  based on the type of document stored.


          Projects of the size involved have many legal and practical
          management  requirements that only a system that is both reliable and
          performing  the core business model can provide. The systems SSW
          provided were  tailored to the exact model that QWI ran its business
          on, and the  systems have used to complete 3 successful projects, with
          further  project work currently underway.


          We used these technologies: Microsoft SharePoint MOSS (Enterprise),
          SQL Server, Reporting Services, WISDOM DMF, Access 2007, ASP.NET 2.0,
          C#, and VB.NET.

          McDonalds needs to track shipments and report on their meats to the
          US, Asia and domestically.


          SSW worked together with McDonalds to build an Access application
          with  SQL backend to help manage their day to day operations. Since
          then SSW  have been porting some existing functions into ClickOnce
          applications  and migrating reports to Reporting Services reports. We
          also provide  training to their users around using Access and writing
          advanced queries.


          Streamlined their operations from a manual system to an automated
          system


          We used these technologies: Access 2003, SQL Server 2005, SSIS, Web
          Services, Great Plains integration, Reporting Services

          SnackBrands were rapidly growing and acquiring other companies. As
          such they had sales data in many different systems. They were
          currently  reporting my manually consolidating figures into excel and
          crunching  the numbers.


          SSW developed the glue that brought all these systems together using
          SSIS to grab and dump the data into a data warehouse. We worked with
          the business users to build a cube off that data that helped report on
          sales, trends, forecasting, volumes, logistics and customers. We also
          setup SnackBrand's SharePoint infrastructure configuring Excel
          services and Reporting Services integration, allowing users to easily
          query the cube and upload and share reports.


          Empowered users to create their own reports, streamlined their
          reporting solution by removing the manual steps.

          2 new DotNetNuke modules for the site and integrated into their
          solution  and bug fixing existing errors on their existing site. SSW
          was also  commissioned to take a new design from eMove and create and
          implement  a DotNetNuke skin for the new design.

          and interviews to  staff training and performance reviews. SSW was
          chosen from a pool of 12  development houses to produce this

          Vulcan Steel approached SSW about a Windows application that needed to
          be updated to the latest technologies to ensure easier maintainability
          and reusability. This app is the backbone of Vulcan Steelâ€™s day-to-day
          business operations.


          They had a desire for a better architecture to allow changes to be
          made quicker, with a lower chance of unintended defects. With an app
          of this magnitude, it is essential to keep it up-to-date and
          functioning perfectly, to ensure a lower total cost of ownership.


          Because this app is so vital, it was also a requirement that the app
          remain up and running during the process of upgrading it to the new
          architecture. The challenges didnâ€™t stop there though: All of the
          logic was embedded in the windows app with no service layer, and
          Vulcan Steelâ€™s IT people are based in New Zealand whilst SSW are in
          Australia.

          (and, if necessary, confidential) contact services via Email, SMS,
          Fax, surface mail and telegram.


          FastAs has no in-house development expertise and, after careful
          evaluation, selected SSW to complete the development and deployment of
          their Internet services. Key considerations were SSW's strong project

          Upgrading a complex Access-based application to the latest

          We are bringing the Access application forward to Silverlight with RIA
          services. Weâ€™re keeping the database schema unchanged so that the new
          version will run in parallel to their existing application, and
          gradually phase the old one out. This also allows us to deploy the new
          version earlier and get the end-users excited.


          Deployment model will be a lot simpler for end-user machines since
          they wonâ€™t need to have Access installed. This will allow Conquest to
          reach a broader market, and simplify the deployment experience.

          Westbus is Sydney's largest private bus company serving the
          communities of Western Sydney and the Hills District by providing
          local, city, school and charter bus services.


          SSW developed Westbus' Charter Booking system to serve multiple
          concurrent users based at the various Westbus depots which service the
          Western Sydney region. The objective was to replace an existing DOS
          system, to automate quote calculation and to integrate with Microsoft
          Great Plains Accounting for invoicing.


          The application was developed as an ASP.NET intranet application using
          a 4 tier design. The .NET Framework 1.1 was used in conjunction with
          SQL Server. The system generates reports powered by Crystal Reports
          whilst being exportable to Adobe Acrobat PDF.


          Daniela Fontana, Westbus Business Development Manager says SSWs simple
          and efficient design has ensured the application has been quickly
          accepted by the depot users.

          AMS is a data staging system that imports and converts data into a
          specialized format for import into the Dyna financial modeling system.
          External outsource service providers send simple files which are
          imported and converted through 3 databases. SSW's role was development
          in Visual Basic, JavaScript and SQL Server 7.0 stored procedures. This
          involved building stored procedures to do data transformation and
          building an ActiveX component to queue and run batch jobs. The web
          interface required programming in JavaScript and VB COM objects.


          SSW worked on this large 3-tier ASP/VB/SQL Server 2000 project. One of
          the requirements was to create a specialized data transformation
          system to feed data into an asset management system for predicting
          future rental prices on all properties owned by the Commonwealth Bank.


          The data would come in as CSV and tab-delimited files (amongst
          others), which would be read into the first SQL Server database via
          DTS. Following this, stored procedures moved and transformed it into
          the second SQL Server database where it was in a standard format. Then
          stored procedures moved it into a third database which was in a
          special format for output into a text script that the Commonwealth
          Bank Asset Management package could read. The 'Administration' and
          'Script Importing' sections of this project used an ASP interface
          created by SSW. Validation of the imported data was done in DTS via a
          Visual Basic 6.0 COM object called by the DTS ActiveX scripts.

          Enterasys Networks Australia, a leading manufacturer of networking
          switches and routers, has partnered with SSW to deploy an automated
          customer tracking database. This new application is the foundation for
          all sales and marketing activities at Cabletron, and includes
          sophisticated product quoting functions.

          The system uses a SQL Server backend, and is designed to automatically
          integrate with Microsoft Outlook and Exchange Server. The solution
          includes a unique data replication feature, automatically transferring
          records from SQL Server to Exchange Server.

          to keep control of many small but nonetheless important tasks and have
          these integrated into a solid reporting and accountable system.


          SSW was commissioned by City Agents to build a custom database to
          manage the day-to-day running of their business. The database was
          built using ADP (Access Data Projects) in Access 2000 with MSDE as the

          enable them to successfully prosecute new prospects and to follow them
          up as the sales process progressed. In particular, it had to tie in
          seamlessly with Microsoft Outlook, which was in general use throughout
          the company.

          Crystal Report, Active X control-based application to Visual Basic
          .NET and SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services. In the process, SSW also
          re-modeled the new Windows Forms application with a proper strongly
          typed data and business logic layer.
