  custom web parts implemented to allow content editors to use content rollup in
  a variety of ways across the site, for example a summary of news items

  ## FEB 2000 - Microsoft Recognition


  Adam Cogan, president of the Sydney .NET Users Group, has been appointed to
  one of only two local Microsoft Regional Director roles.


  In the voluntary role, which is not compensated by Microsoft, Adam will
  provide an important sounding board between the software giant and its
  developer community according to Nick Abbott, Product Manager of developer
  tools and the MS program at Microsoft Australia.


  *"The role speaks a lot about Adam and his role in the developer community"*
  Abbott said. *"It's one thing to be a good developer, but it's another to be
  well known and respected within your community and Adam is rapidly gaining an
  international reputation."* The role involves travelling to Microsoft's
  Redmond campus every 6-12 months, and as such, Adam was quite excited by the
  possibilities.


  *"This is the opportunity of a lifetime."* Adam said, adding that Regional
  Directors are generally privy to Microsoft software and directions before the
  rest of the developer community, which will assist in his numerous public
  speaking appearances and internal training of staff at SSW.


  Cogan is filling the role recently vacated by Dr Richard Hunter of
  Brisbane-based software developer, Fair Play, perhaps best known for software
  such as â€˜The Cricket Analystâ€™ used by sports coaches and competitors.
  Australia's other Microsoft Regional Director is Brian Walsh, director of
  Praxa's .NET practice.


  Microsoft works with around 140 Microsoft Regional Directors worldwide.
