  ## Challenge


  Hutchison Weller, a company that focuses on managing the environmental impacts
  for their clients in the construction market, had a personalized noise
  management spreadsheet as part of their services that could be tailored for
  each client on Excel. Even though they had demand for this service, it was
  time-consuming to personalize it every time a new client signed-in for the
  service. Hutchison Weller knew they needed a new solution in order to keep
  selling their noise management consultancy.


  ## We make complicated things simple


  Hutchison Weller wanted KNOWnoise to save time, money and to greatly increase
  flexibility for project managers on linear infrastructure projects.


  Their needs were some of these:


  * Besides that, Hutchison Weller's clients also needed flexibility in
  planning, particularly out-of-hours works, when they tend to have problems.
  Now there's no need to wait for a consultant to prepare a report

  * Direct their resources where needed most, being able to identify the worst
  impacts instantly

  * Identify specific receivers that may require notification or alternative
  accommodation, being able to save the community consultation team valuable
  time and to inform the community with a detailed understanding of the
  potential impacts previously of starting the project


  More than just a predicted noise level, KNOWnoise now can provide the project
  team with:


  * The ability to assess virtually any combination of activity at any time or
  place

  * A built-in equipment list, that can be modified or augmented

  * Detailed prediction results identifying exceedances, cumulative impacts and
  colour-coded risk profiles. This can also include ancillary facilities
  (compounds)

  * 'Impact maps' showing colour-coded noise predictions and risk profiles

  * A printable report for approval and record-keeping. It's also possible to
  export all results/report to Excel

  * Calendar-based scheduling and management

  * Advice on compliance and control measures based on results and conditions of
  approval, Environment Protection Licenses or other licence or permit
  obligations


  ## Technology


  KNOWnoise was re-developed as a web application and deployed within 3 months.
  This application was built using Angular and NgRx in the frontend. The backend
  was developed using .Net Core, hosted on Azure, and following the Clean
  Architecture principles.


  ## Results


  KNOWnoise now allows managers to model noise impacts on neighbourhoods
  surrounding noisy construction sites such as NorthConnex, featured in this
  six-minute testimonial video. Additional positive impacts include improved
  community relations and regulatory compliance.
