  ## Challenge


  WorleyParsons is one of the world's top engineering and project delivery
  companies.

  SharePoint was implemented extensively across their organization, but they
  were looking to extend the development to include their new public website.
  After a lengthy tendering process, WorleyParsons chose SSW to develop their
  new public website and it is now powered by SharePoint 2007.

  ## We make complicated things simple


  The site and all components were to be reusable, so site templates, page
  layouts, content types and web parts were used extensively. This allows
  WorleyParsons employees with sufficient permissions to manage and maintain the
  website without requiring any assistance from developers.

  ## Smooth Deployment via SSWpackage.exe


  Migration between development, staging and production servers was simplified
  by using SharePoint packaging functionality and using the suite of STSADM
  commands to deploy the components. SSW developed a tool to simplify the
  addition of all components to the package, as this process can be time
  consuming and error prone.


  ## Results


  The [www.worleyparsons.com](https://www.worley.com/) website has been released
  and is live to the public. Both the client and the development team were very
  satisfied with the result. The project was completed in 10 weeks and delivered
  in line with the customers requirements.
