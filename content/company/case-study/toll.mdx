  Toll Transport is one of Australia's largest logistics and trucking companies.
  Toll comprises a network of businesses that work individually and collectively
  to deliver optimal logistics solutions across all industry sectors. Toll was
  looking to track and understand the movements of their Toll Linehaul fleet
  across the country. They needed to optimise the travel to reduce costs, meet
  government compliance, and manage their trucks and drivers.

  ## Results


  Toll was able to meet their compliance requirement sand understand the
  location of their drivers when emergencies occurred, and inform their clients
  of delays in real time. Something they could not do in the past. This has
  revolutionised their business.
