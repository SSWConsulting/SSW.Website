  ## Challenge


  Event Cinemas is Australia's leading Cinema company.

  They were looking to revamp their website with a new look and feel with the
  added ability to drive the site via a new CMS. [Six different CMS
  options](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/consulting/ContentManagement.aspx) were
  assessed and [Telerik's
  Sitefinity](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/sitefinity) was chosen.

  Cinema Home page " alignment="items-start" width={800} height={400}
  customClass="my-0" caption="Figure: Homepage with fullscreen image of movie"
  />


  ## We make complicated things simple


  Using the Scrum methodology, we made sure that the most important parts of the
  system were built and tested 1st, ensuring transparency and value creation all
  the way through the development lifecycle. The site and all components were to
  be reusable, so site templates, page layouts, content types and custom contols
  were used extensively. This allows Event Cinemas employees with sufficient
  permissions to manage and maintain the website without requiring any
  assistance from developers.


  ## Integration


  We have live integration with the backend ticketing systems located at the 50+
  cinemas Australia wide. This means that users can jump online and order a
  movie ticket with seating reservations in real time.

  ## Results


  The [www.eventcinemas.com.au](https://www.eventcinemas.com.au) website has
  been released and is live to the public. Both the client and the development
  team were very satisfied with the result.
