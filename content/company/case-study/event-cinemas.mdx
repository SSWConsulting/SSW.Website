  ## Challenge


  Event Cinemas is Australia's leading Cinema company.

  They were looking to revamp their website with a new look and feel with the added ability to drive the site via a new CMS.
  [Six different CMS options](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/consulting/ContentManagement.aspx) were assessed and [Telerik's Sitefinity](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/sitefinity) was chosen.

  ## We make complicated things simple


  Using the Scrum methodology, we made sure that the most important parts of the system were built and tested 1st, ensuring transparency and value creation all the way through the development lifecycle.
  The site and all components were to be reusable, so site templates, page layouts, content types and custom contols were used extensively.
  This allows Event Cinemas employees with sufficient permissions to manage and maintain the website without requiring any assistance from developers.


  ## Integration


  We have live integration with the backend ticketing systems located at the 50+ cinemas Australia wide.
  This means that users can jump online and order a movie ticket with seating reservations in real time.

  Both the client and the development team were very satisfied with the result.
