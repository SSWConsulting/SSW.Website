  ## Challenge

  Brisbane Catholic Education engaged SSW to build a strategic planning tool
  that would be powerful, flexible, and easy to use for all of their schools
  administrators across South-East Queensland.


  ## We make complicated things simple


  Using the Scrum methodology, we made sure that the most important parts of the
  system were built and tested first, ensuring transparency and value creation
  all the way through the development lifecycle.


  ## Communication


  When working in large organisations with many stakeholders, communication is
  key. By delivering early and often, ensuring a constant feedback cycle and
  engaging with staff across the organisation including senior management,
  stakeholders, testers and end-users, SSW ensured that the project delivered
  not just a great technical solution, but a solution that truly delighted the
  users.


  ## Results


  Having engaged other software development companies previously, Brisbane
  Catholic Education were stunned by the rate at which SSW developers were able
  to convert ideas into quality working software, gather feedback and release to
  production.

  Since collaborating on Sparrow, BCE have successfully applied the knowledge
  and practices they learnt from SSW across many other projects for various
  divisions of the organisation.
