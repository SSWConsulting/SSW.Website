  ## Challenge


  Maximus International is a boutique organizational assessment and development
  consultancy that offers commercially savvy, unique solutions to business. To
  support their business they needed a HRIS web application to help manage the
  HR Process, from initial selection and interviews to staff training and
  performance reviews. SSW was chosen from a pool of 12 development houses to
  produce this application based on ASP.NET 2.0, AJAX and NHibernate
  technologies.

  ## Process


  ### Agile Development


  We adopted an agile/extreme programming development paradigm so that we could
  get user feedback early in the development process and react to change
  requests quickly. A good example of this is the weekly demonstrations on
  Friday afternoons to the client and some end users. The goals of the
  demonstrations were to showcase the progress achieved in the current week and
  to obtain feedback from the end users of the system. These demonstrations were
  positively received.


  ### Usability


  A lot of attention was paid to the usability of the system for end users. The
  iterative agile approach allowed us to fine tune the navigation of the system
  so that most parts of the system were accessible within 6 clicks of the mouse.


  We also used Microsoft AJAX technology where possible to create a more rich
  and interactive experience for users of the system. An example of this is the
  drag and drop organisation structure, the autosuggest search fields and search
  screens.


  The usability of the system has been well received from the live and pilot
  clients of the system.


  ### Software as a Service


  One of the main requirements of the application was to make it customizable
  for each client. The main areas of customization are the themes, reports and
  business logic.

  The customization of themes was achieved through Master Pages and ASP.NET
  Theming engine.


  The reports were customizable through custom XSL templates for each client
  (for use with XML FO)


  The business logic was customized through pluggable libraries for each client.


  ## Technologies


  The Web Application is built on Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 with a SQL Server 2000
  backend. The persistence layer used was NHibernate Â¨C although we did consider
  using LINQ but it was too immature at that stage.


  We also incorporated Microsoft AJAX to create a richer user experience.


  For reporting we used XML FO and Component Art Web Charts to produce rich
  documents that could not be done in SQL Reporting Services or Crystal Reports.


  ## Results


  We have received very positive feedback from the live and pilot users of the
  system. Maximus are beginning to roll out the system to some of their clients.


  ## Australia Wide


  We have consultants available in all Australian capital cities including
  Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Canberra.
