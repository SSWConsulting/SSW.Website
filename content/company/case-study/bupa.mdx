  ## Problem 


  By 2020 Bupa’s claims-recovery teams were looking to streamline processes that
  used spreadsheets, email threads and several niche applications. The approach
  made it hard to see the full lifecycle of an insurance case, introduced
  governance risk around personally identifiable information and became
  increasingly expensive to maintain as supporting infrastructure neared
  end-of-life. Bupa wanted a secure, modern solution that could streamline these
  activities, grow with future demand and be delivered without a disruptive
  multi-year program.


  ## Solution


  ### Phase 1 – Initial Build  


  SSW created Sentinel, a web application built on a distributed-services
  architecture. Rather than developing a complex drag-and-drop workflow engine,
  SSW and Bupa defined a concise set of process states that covered everyday
  scenarios while keeping the codebase lean. 


  The system was sized for roughly ten million records, providing ample headroom
  beyond the original estimate of one hundred thousand. A full Azure Active
  Directory integration supplied role-based access, detailed audit trails and a
  secure mode for internal fraud investigations. 


  The below are some mock-ups for the case management system:
