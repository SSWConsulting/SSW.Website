  ## Challenge


  Bupa is one of the largest providers of health cover in Australia. Bupa's
  agents handle hundreds of insurance claim cases every day. They used to use
  Excel to connect to their database to track and update those claim cases,
  which is slow, crashed easily, no security restriction and not user friendly.


  ### We make complicated things simple


  Bupa's case management was very complicated due to case types, status, payment
  and financial attributes' variety.

  SSW created a user friendly interface for agents to manage cases more
  efficiently. We integrated with their existing membership database and built
  the system with case status workflow logic at the backend.


  The below are some mock-ups for the case management system:

  required fields filled, the other fields are filled in nightly**


  ![Update claims mock-up](/images/case-studies/bupa-mockup-3.jpg)**Figure: Update claims related
  to a case, which will automatically update case status**

  which will automatically update case status**


  ![Change log mock-up](/images/case-studies/bupa-mockup-5.jpg)**Figure: Change log of a case can be
  checked in the "history" tab**


  ## Results


  Bupa's agents are able to see all their cases' statuses on a dashboard, and
  work out which cases need to be followed up. They can also easily create and
  update the case in a few clicks. Something that needed much more manual effort
  to do in the past.
