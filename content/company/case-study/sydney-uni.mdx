  ## Challenge


  High quality breast imaging and accurate image assessment are critical to the
  early diagnoses, treatment and management of women with cancer. Mammography is
  the primary diagnostic tool for detecting breast cancer with 800,000 women
  X-rayed annually in Australia; however, it fails to detect 30% of breast
  cancers, with many missed cancers being visible on the image.


  Radiologist's fear of making a false diagnosis is well justified… such an
  event can have a devastating impact on patients, creating anxiety and distress
  which we know can last for years. We also know that such anxiety can lead to
  illness. During training some radiologists have even been known to say things
  like "I missed that one cancer – so I just killed a woman". It's critical that
  radiologists can diagnose different types of lesions, but just as important
  that they can clearly recognise what is "normal", with instant feedback on
  their performance. They needed to know what errors they made, why, and how to
  avoid them. Misdiagnosis missed cancer or false positives could be reduced.


  ## We make complicated things simple


  In an outstanding example of clinical and academic collaboration, the Cancer
  Institute of NSW, and the BREAST research group at the University of Sydney’s
  Faculty of Health Sciences, had previously developed a web-based app in-house
  some years ago. This innovative new training tool was named "Detected", which
  works in parallel with the hospital-grade picture archiving system, PACS, as a
  tool that gives radiologists immediate feedback on their performance when they
  are looking at mammograms and trying make a diagnosis.


  However, it lacked the real time feedback and offline capability they needed
  for learning conferences. It also required manual processes involving copying
  and pasting between offline and online spreadsheets, being a time-consuming
  task for the radiologists whilst learning. Finally, it lacked 3D capability
  used in more detailed assessments after a positive lesion identification.


  Then, we accepted Sydney University's challenge and started working together
  on this project. Using our agile development methodology and collaborating
  closely with the BREAST research group, we were able to deliver a new,
  upgraded version of the web application that allows trainees to diagnose the
  type of cancer & specify where it is, then receive instant feedback on their
  performance vs benchmarks and their peers.


  **"Detected"** replicates the operation/procedures radiologists would normally
  perform in a clinical setting and is used in tandem with high resolution
  imagery in PACS.


  For example, rolling the mouse wheel through slices of a 3-D image or Zooming,
  inverting an image or adjusting the contrast all happens exactly as it would
  in hospital. Three main features were developed:


  * Simple Subscription for web browser users with easy self-service setup

  * Offline capability with seamless synchronisation

  * Added 3D imagery for more detailed assessments after positive lesion
  identification


  SSW's agile approach to software development meant that we could prioritise
  new features based on available funding and the specific value they would
  provide to the professional handling it. We were able to try an early version
  at a conference late in 2018, and then finally added the 3D feature on March
  2019.


  ## Technology


  This solution was built in .NET Core for the back-end and Angular for the
  front-end and the whole application was hosted in Azure.


  ## Results


  Now radiologists can feel more confident in their abilities and improve their
  performances by using this powerful tool to increase their expertise and
  accurate diagnoses.


  We are very proud of SSW's contribution to this life-changing project, and we
  look forward to any future developments that will benefit all of our mothers,
  aunties, daughters, sisters & friends.
