  The Northern Sydney Institute, part of TAFE NSW, is one of Australiaâ€™s leading

  providers of vocational training and tertiary education.


  ## Challenge


  Many websites are needed for the Institute, with websites for the brand,
  international

  versions, and microsites for subdivisions.\n\nThe websites require a lot of
  maintenance and

  constant content changes. Prior to SSW developing the Sitefinity solution,
  this was all done

  manually within a small IT team.


  A CMS was desperately needed to allow subdivisions to update their sites and
  content

  directly (with an approval workflow).

  ## Integration


  North Sydney Institute have a corporate booking system that the website
  required

  integration with, allowing students to sign up for courses without having to
  go

  onto a campus to enrol.

  ## Results


  The [www.theapa.edu.au](http://www.theapa.edu.au/) website has been released

  and is live to the public. Both the client and the development team were very

  satisfied with the result. SSW are currently developing phase two of the
  website

  and integrating a shopping cart.
