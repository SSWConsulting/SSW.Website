  The Northern Sydney Institute, part of TAFE NSW, is one of Australiaâ€™s leading
  providers of vocational training and tertiary education.

  ## Challenge

  Many websites are needed for the Institute, with websites for the brand, international
  versions, and microsites for subdivisions.\n\nThe websites require a lot of maintenance and
  constant content changes. Prior to SSW developing the Sitefinity solution, this was all done
  manually within a small IT team.

  A CMS was desperately needed to allow subdivisions to update their sites and content
  directly (with an approval workflow).

  ## Integration

  North Sydney Institute have a corporate booking system that the website required
  integration with, allowing students to sign up for courses without having to go
  onto a campus to enrol.

  ## Results

  The [www.theapa.edu.au](http://www.theapa.edu.au/) website has been released
  and is live to the public. Both the client and the development team were very
  satisfied with the result. SSW are currently developing phase two of the website
  and integrating a shopping cart.
