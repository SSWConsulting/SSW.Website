  ## Challenge


  eMove is a free online service for finding removalist quotes; utility
  connections/disconnections; address changes; cleaners; storage; packing and
  much more.

  SSW was brought into the project to provide new functionality for the
  removalist quotes and utility connections/disconnections. SSW created 2 new
  DotNetNuke modules for the site and integrated into their solution and bug
  fixing existing errors on their existing site. SSW was also commissioned to
  take a new design from eMove and create and implement a DotNetNuke skin for
  the new design.

    </>}
    secondColBody={<>
      <CustomImage src="/images/case-studies/emove-2.jpg" altText="eMove - After" alignment="items-start" height={330} width={319} caption="Figure: After" customClass="my-1" />
    </>}
  />


  ## Process


  ### DotNetNuke Skin Creation


  eMove provided SSW with a Photoshop (PSD File) design of the new look for the
  site. SSW's team of graphic designers sliced up the file into dozens of images
  and created the css stylesheet for the colour scheme and layout. SSW then
  created the new DotNetNuke skin using these files that were created for all
  pages on the eMove website.


  ### DotNetNuke Modules


  As part of the new design eMove wanted to add new functionality to their
  existing website. Two new modules were created: "Removalists quotes" and
  "Connections/Disconnections". The "removalists quotes" section contained
  wizard functionality to move between steps with validation and dynamic updates
  using AJAX technologies to create a user friendly experience.


  ## Technologies


  The Web Application is built on Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 using DotNetNuke with a
  SQL Server 2005 backend. We also incorporated Microsoft AJAX and used Telerik
  RADControls for ASP.Net to create a richer user experience in the custom
  Desktop Modules.


  ## Results


  The project was deployed successfully and the client has indicated they are
  extremely satisified with the end result.
