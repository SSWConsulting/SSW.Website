  ## Challenge


  EstateMaster wanted a good looking website, based upon a CMS so their
  marketing people could manage content. A dynamic client area was also needed,
  allowing clients to login and manage software licenses. A shopping cart was
  also required, allowing clients to purchase software products, pay for and
  generate license keys.

  master landing page" alignment="items-start" width={750} height={400}
  customClass="Vertical margin (my-0)" caption="Figure: EstateMaster Website
  Homepage" />

  ## Integration


  The website is heavily integrated with Salesforce, which contains
  EstateMaster's products and pricing data, along with custom invoicing
  processes which needed to be maintained.

  A process was created that refreshed products and pricing on a nightly basis,
  ensuring the website remained responsive while people were browsing.
  Additionally, a custom Salesforce authentication provider was created with
  controls allowing clients to view and edit license details directly into the
  license server.

  ## Results


  The [estatemaster.com](https://www.estatemaster.com) website has been released
  and is live to the public. Both the client and the development team were very
  satisfied with such a fluid website that is based upon the CRM and SalesForce.
