  #### A Chatbot Is Easy; a Correct Chatbot Is Not


  Anyone can wire a large-language model to a website and have it spit out
  answers. The real trick is **trust**—especially when the answers change
  people’s pay packets and expose you to Fair Work fines.


  APA asked us to build an AI assistant that could handle day-to-day payroll
  questions *and* meet the same compliance bar as their human consultants. That
  meant we had to solve two problems at once:


  1. **Get the facts right every time.**

  2. **Know when to stay silent or call in a human.**

  #### Where Generic AI Falls Short


  Payroll law is a maze of awards, allowances, and edge cases. A vanilla model
  will happily “fill in the gaps” when it’s unsure. In payroll that can lead to:


  * Wrong penalty rates

  * Mislabelled employee types

  * Bad advice on leave loading or terminations


  We treated each of those failure modes as a design requirement, not an
  after-thought.

  #### The Four Layers We Added


  | Layer                               | What It
  Does                                                                            
  | Nuance We
  Learned

  | **1. Private knowledge base (RAG)** | The bot pulls answers only from APA’s
  vetted docs and live government pages.             | Even “official” sites
  sometimes lag behind award changes. We built a daily crawler to spot updates
  and trigger re-indexing. |

  | **2. Question scrubber**            | Rewrites the user’s query to remove
  hidden assumptions (e.g., “casual” vs “part-time”).  | We found 15 % of
  queries mixed up employment types; cleaning them first cut error rates in
  half.                            |

  | **3. Response gatekeeper**          | A post-process check flags anything
  that looks like legal advice or falls outside scope. | Instead of blocking the
  answer outright, we direct the user to a human payroll specialist—no dead
  ends.                     |

  | **4. Continuous benchmark**         | Every week we sample answers and score
  them against APA experts.                         | Tracking the *type* of
  miss (rate, classification, threshold) guides what to fix next, not just an
  accuracy percentage.     |

  #### Practical Ideas You Can Steal


  1. **Limit the playground.** Lock your bot to the docs you’d hand a new
  employee.

  2. **Automate humility.** Build a rule that says, “If confidence \< X or topic
  = Y, escalate.”

  3. **Treat accuracy like uptime.** Put a metric on it, review it on a
  schedule, and own the failures.

  4. **Keep domain experts in the loop—forever.** Their feedback is not a
  project phase; it’s the maintenance plan.

  #### Outcome


  APA now offers instant answers for routine payroll questions while reserving
  tricky cases for humans. Compliance risk is lower, support tickets are
  shorter, and the knowledge base stays current without monthly PDF drops.

  Thinking about doing something similar? Start with a plain chatbot if you
  like, but budget time for the guard-rails. That’s where the real work—and the
  real value—lives.
