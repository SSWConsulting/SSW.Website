  ## An Agent Is Easy; a Correct Agent Is Not


  Anyone can spin up an [AI
  agent](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/ai-agents-what-they-are-and-how-theyll-change-the-way-we-work/)
  these days. But keeping it from giving dangerously wrong payroll advice is the
  hard part, and that’s the part the Australian Payroll Association (APA) asked
  SSW to solve.


  As Australia's leading payroll authority, APA wanted to create an **AI‑powered
  Payroll Agent.** The goal was to provide instant, compliant information, but
  the stakes were high. Payroll rules change often, are nested in thick award
  tables, and carry heavy fines if you get them wrong. A normal “vanilla” AI
  model (the out‑of‑the‑box version of ChatGPT) hasn’t read those rules and will
  happily guess. That guessing is called a hallucination, where the AI sounds
  certain, but the facts are off. One bad answer could under‑pay staff or breach
  Fair Work laws.


  Our challenge was to engineer an agentic architecture that eliminated the
  guesswork, ensuring every answer the AI produced was accurate and reliable.\

  \

  Our brief:


  1. Serve complex payroll questions instantly.

  2. Never mislead the user.

  3. Escalate tricky cases to a human before damage is done.

  ## Where Generic AI Falls Short


  Payroll law is a maze of awards, allowances, and edge cases. A vanilla model
  will happily “fill in the gaps” when it’s unsure. In payroll that can lead to:


  * Incorrectly calculated superannuation

  * Incorrect payments of leave

  * Bad advice on award interpretation or terminations


  We treated each of those failure modes as a design requirement, not an
  after-thought.

  ## The Four Layers We Added


  | Layer                               | What It
  Does                                                                            
  | Nuance We
  Learned

  |

  | **1. Private knowledge base (RAG)** | The bot pulls answers only from APA’s
  vetted docs and live government pages.             | Even “official” sites
  sometimes lag behind award changes. We built a daily crawler to spot updates
  and trigger re-indexing. |

  | **2. Question scrubber**            | Rewrites the user’s query to remove
  hidden assumptions (e.g., “casual” vs “part-time”).  | We found 15 % of
  queries mixed up employment types; cleaning them first cut error rates in
  half.                            |

  | **3. Response gatekeeper**          | A post-process-check flags anything
  that looks like legal advice or falls outside scope. | Instead of blocking the
  answer outright, we direct the user to a human payroll specialist, no dead
  ends.                    |

  | **4. Continuous benchmark**         | Every week we sample answers and score
  them against APA experts.                         | Tracking the *type* of
  miss (rate, classification, threshold) guides what to fix next, not just an
  accuracy percentage.     |

  ## Outcomes


  * Faster answers: Routine questions are handled in seconds.

  * Lower risk: High-stakes issues auto-escalate to humans.

  * Current data: Award changes roll in overnight without PDF updates.


  APA now trusts the bot to handle everyday queries while their specialists
  focus on the edge cases.

  ## Lessons for Other Business Owners


  1. Ground the AI in your own docs. Do not let it roam the open web.

  2. Build in humility. If confidence is low or the stakes are high, escalate.

  3. Measure accuracy like uptime. Review a sample of answers on a set schedule.

  4. Keep experts in the loop forever. Their feedback is part of maintenance,
  not a one-off step.


  Add these guard-rails early, and you can turn any “vanilla” AI into a reliable
  assistant, without gambling on hallucinations.
