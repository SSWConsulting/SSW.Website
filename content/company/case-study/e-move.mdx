## Challenge


eMove is a free online service for finding removalist quotes; utility connections/disconnections; address changes; cleaners; storage; packing and much more.

SSW was brought into the project to provide new functionality for the removalist quotes and utility connections/disconnections.
SSW created 2 new DotNetNuke modules for the site and integrated into their solution and bug fixing existing errors on their existing site.
SSW was also commissioned to take a new design from eMove and create and implement a DotNetNuke skin for the new design.

## Process


### DotNetNuke Skin Creation

eMove provided SSW with a Photoshop (PSD File) design of the new look for the site.
SSW's team of graphic designers sliced up the file into dozens of images and created the css stylesheet for the colour scheme and layout.
SSW then created the new DotNetNuke skin using these files that were created for all pages on the eMove website.

### DotNetNuke Modules

As part of the new design eMove wanted to add new functionality to their existing website.
Two new modules were created; [Removalists quotes](https://emove.com.au/Default.aspx?tabid=59) and [Connections/Disconnections](https://emove.com.au/ConnectDisconnect/tabid/61/Default.aspx).
The removalists quotes section contained wizard functionality to move between steps with validation and dynamic updates using AJAX technologies to create a user friendly experience.


## Technologies


The Web Application is built on Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 using DotNetNuke with a SQL Server 2005 backend.

We also incorporated Microsoft AJAX and used Telerik RADControls for ASP.Net to create a richer user experience in the custom Desktop Modules.


## Results


The project was deployed successfully and the client has indicated they are extremely satisified with the end result.
