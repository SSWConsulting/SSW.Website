  ## Challenge


  Medibank Private engage SSW to help implement ALM and DevOps for their
  internal application development, testing and support. Their currently process
  involved numerous manual steps and had to involved many different departments
  to coordinate the development, deployment and testing resources for their
  application. This was a highly inefficient process.


  ## Technologies


  * TFS 2015

  * Lab Manager

  * Test Manager

  * Coded UI Tests

  * Powershell

  * Hyper-V

  * SCVMM

  * SQL Server 2008


  ## Results


  SSW implemented TFS with Test Manager and Lab Manager for Medibank Private.
  This meant that when code was checked in:


  1. An automated build was kicked off

  2. Artefacts were created for the application and database upgrade scripts

  3. A 3 VMs in Hyper-V was spun up where:
     1. The windows application was deployed (Windows XP and Windows Vista)
     2. The SQL server database was restored and upgraded to the latest schema
  4. Automated UI tests than ran in the VM to verify there were no regressions

  5. A report was sent to the test managers and they had the opportunity to jump
  into the VM to manually test failing elements

  6. If there were test failures, a bug was created with the VM details and
  IntelliTrace logs


  This process streamlined an automated their development pipeline from weeks to
  create a release to under a day.
