  ## Challenge


  PwC approached SSW to take an internally developed Excel application driven by
  macros, that assisted their clients in producing tax returns, and turn it into
  a fully fledged core application for PwC to help clients manage their tax
  obligations in an automated fashion. The initial scope of the application was
  to service the Australian market with the intention to expand to other markets
  globally.


  ## Process


  The first step was to review the existing Excel application and extract the
  calculation logic and then to design the architect of the application to allow
  for additional modules and customizations for each client.


  ## Technology


  The initial version of ComplyFirstTime (CFT) was written using ASP.NET MVC
  with a SQL backend. However, keeping pace with rapidly changing technology,
  new CFT features are primarily written in Angular and WebAPI.


  ## Results


  CFT is now the standard platform being pushed by PwC globally. It has grown to
  cater for tax obligations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland,
  United Kingdom, India, Singapore, Mexico and other European countries and has
  been successfully deployed to over 50 large organizations.
