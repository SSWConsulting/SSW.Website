  ## Challenge


  Aurecon - formerly known as Connell Wagner - identified SharePoint as the
  product of choice to replace various Lotus Notes applications in use within
  their business including their intranet portal. SSW were brought in to
  architect a SharePoint farm for their user base of over 6000 employees
  worldwide, implement the first part of their portal using best practices for
  development and deployment, and to train their developers and support staff.


  ## SharePoint Functionality


  The first part of the portal to be developed was for Knowledge Groups; groups
  of employees throughout the organization that work within a similar
  operational area. Each Knowledge Group was to have a unique site based on a
  template that provided the following components:


  * Publishing functionality

  * A discussion forum

  * Document management

  * A standard navigation and interface

  * User information

  SSW built a custom site definition that allowed the required functionality to
  be provisioned when a new Knowledge Group is created. In addition, the
  template can be reapplied to an existing site resetting configurations such as
  permissions and navigation in the event of user corruption.


  ## Document Management and Search


  OpenText Enterprise Content Management (formerly known as LiveLink) was in use
  at Aurecon, so document management within SharePoint was not required. In
  addition, SharePoint was only required to crawl and index content within the
  SharePoint portal. OpenText provides web parts to integrate with SharePoint to
  allow federated search results of both OpenText and SharePoint search results.
  SSW integrated the OpenText components within SharePoint to ensure a seamless
  user experience was created, and there be no requirement to context switch
  between applications when working with documents, searching, or using
  collaboration features of SharePoint.


  ## User Experience


  Aurecon had specific branding guidelines that the SharePoint portal had to
  meet. Thanks to SSW's experience in working with the SharePoint front end,
  this did not prove difficult.

  ## Process


  A best practice development environment was put in place with processes to
  match. A SharePoint image was built which allowed for rapid rollout SharePoint
  Virtual Machine (VM) servers:


  * Each developer worked on an isolated SharePoint VM environment to prevent
  deployment interference with other developers

  * A Build, Verification and Testing (BVT) server was built, and build scripts
  configured using NAnt to allow continuous integration

  * The UAT SharePoint farm was built to mirror the production environment


  Each day the SharePoint package was automatically compiled and deployed onto
  the BVT server. Unit tests were then run to validate the deployment. Upon
  failure of any tests, the development team was notified and forced to fix the
  errors immediately. This process ensured that each component being built was
  proven to be deployed and operating successfully. This in turn allowed UAT
  deployments at the end of each iteration to run smoothly and to avoid holding
  up the business from testing the portal.


  ## Results


  SSW saw the deployment of the Knowledge Group portal into production and
  continues to work with Aurecon and their SharePoint requirements.


  > The team from SSW had the right mix of technical expertise and functional
  understanding of our business model to help us to realise a successful outcome
  for our business. We also appreciated their high level of commitment and
  professionalism during the project.
