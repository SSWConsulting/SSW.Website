        content: >
          Angular Hack Days are fun, free events designed for everyone with an
          interest in Angular. With experts on hand to help out, beginners can
          learn the basics and get their hands dirty with their first apps.
          Folks who are more experienced with Angular are still just as likely
          to learn something new, as well getting the opportunity to mingle with
          other devs and share their own ideas and discoveries.
