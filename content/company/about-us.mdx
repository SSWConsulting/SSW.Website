subTitle: "# Australia's Leading Software Consultants\n\n## Why should you choose SSW?\n\n<VideoEmbed url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jveq6VFjWTA\" uncentre={true} removeMargin={true} caption=\"The people behind SSW - Australia's leading software consultancy\" duration=\"3 mins\" />\n\n## Enterprise Software Development\n\nSSW's Consulting Services have delivered the best breed Microsoft solutions for thousands of clients in 15 countries over more than 30 years. With over 100 consultants in 4 countries, SSW's developers are some of the best in the business. We have many Microsoft Certifications, several MVPs, and a Microsoft Regional Director.\n\nWe deliver scalable and extensible custom solutions with the future in mind. Our solutions improve businesses' bottom lines, with real time savings and long-term value. We will provide you with the competitive advantage you need.\n\n* **Screening** – We only hire highly skilled people, and they have to do multiple rounds of interviews, communication tests, and day-long coding tests before they can work at SSW.\n* **Induction** – We then run them through many weeks of [onboarding and training](https://sugarlearning.com/), to ensure they know our coding, communication, and Scrum standards back to front.\n* **Ongoing training** – our strong retrospective culture means that we never stop learning. We take feedback seriously and always look for opportunities to better ourselves and our processes.\n* **Thought leaders** – many of our devs choose to utilise the platform that SSW gives them to become thought leaders in their field, and produce educational content in the form of videos on [SSW TV](https://www.youtube.com/c/sswtv) (1k videos and 40k subscribers), articles on the [SSW Rules](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/choose-the-right-api-tech/), and speaking opportunities at the many [User Groups we run](https://www.ssw.com.au/netug) and Developer Conferences.\n* **Specialists** – We have very senior expertise across the full stack, including Cloud, Database, Back End, Front End, AI, UX and Design, and DevOps. For example, many of our clients bring in a Cloud expert in for 1 Sprint, or a DevOps expert in to help optimize the pipeline.\n\nWe aim to build it right the first time. We reduce project risk through excellent communication, transparency, and fast feedback loops. We build powerful software with intuitive user experiences that allow people to automate complex tasks and see meaningful insights, and hopefully we can help your business to make better decisions.\n\nWe focus on 3 things:\n\n✅ Getting you working software\\\n✅ Keeping you informed\\\n✅ Supporting your software once it's in production\n\n[SSW clients](https://www.ssw.com.au/company/testimonials) include medium sized\ncompanies (e.g. Hutchison Weller), government organizations (e.g. Tourism Australia),\nand large companies (e.g. Microsoft, Toll Transport, BUPA, Allianz, PwC, CBA,\nThe University of Sydney, Brisbane Catholic Education).
