  title: SSW Culture
  description: >
    SSW's company culture is rooted in .NET consultancy, Scrum methodologies,
    and software development best practices. Our "Make it happen" makes us one
    of the most effective, efficient, and innovative tech consultancies in
    Australia and beyond.
title: SSW Culture
subTitle: >
  A company's culture pervades everything a company does, and as such our
  reputation for delivering high quality software comes from the SSW culture. As
  one of Australia's longest-running .NET consultancies, SSW is mature but
  flexible, always evolving to include the best cumulative values, attitudes,
  standards, and beliefs of the employees.


  Though culture can be nebulous and changeable, it is a point of pride at SSW
  that our culture is always underpinned by the following:


  ## "Make it happen"


  We work together to provide solutions to problems for our clients every day,
  and this proactivity happens internally too.


  We are effective and make sure our time counts.


  We always leave meetings with clear action items and knowing what's expected
  from everyone.


  We use [Scrum](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/scrum) extensively to help
  with prioritization and work transparency.


  ## Appreciation


  We understand that not everyone communicates and listens the same way, and
  that what's important to some may not be important to all. However, it is
  human to want to feel appreciated for our effort, so at SSW we keep this in
  mind when making an employee feel valued for their work.

  languages of
  love](https://tv.ssw.com/6931/the-5-languages-of-appreciation-in-the-workplace-with-kylie-hunt).


  ## Innovation


  Keeping on the cutting edge of technology, we're always looking out for the
  latest and greatest way of doing everything. We use the latest version of
  everything, sometime while it’s still in Beta (or even Alpha) stage. Being
  flexible and able to pivot as required means we’re ready for anything.


  ## Consistency


  We have documented all of the best practices we can possibly think of in our
  [Rules to Better 'Everything'](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules), and are always
  trying to make sure we're following and updating them whenever possible. We
  have also made a number of apps that enforce our coding standards in our work,
  such as [SSW Link Auditor](https://linkauditor.com.au/) and [SSW Code
  Auditor](https://www.codeauditor.com/).


  We also have an extensive induction program built on
  [SugarLearning](https://www.sugarlearning.com/), which ensures we’re all on
  the same page with regards to our roles, rights, and responsibilities at the
  company. Each person who undertakes this induction is asked to provide
  feedback, to make sure the process is as fresh and accurate as possible.


  ## Community involvement


  We run multiple user groups including the
  [Sydney](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Sydney.aspx),
  [Melbourne](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Melbourne.aspx), and
  [Canberra](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Canberra.aspx) .NET User Groups,
  the [Brisbane](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Brisbane.aspx) Full Stack User
  Group and the Fire User Group in [Beijing and
  Hangzhou](https://fireusergroup.com/). We encourage as many of our employees
  as possible to share their tech passions by speaking at other User Groups and
  industry events such as Ignite, Build, NDC, etc.


  SSW also runs our own TV channel called [SSW TV](http://tv.ssw.com/), filled
  with content on the latest technologies. SSW TV encompasses everything from
  recordings of presentations and conferences, videos from our training courses,
  webinars, interviews and more. All content on SSW TV is available to anyone,
  100% free, no sign up required.


  ## SSW Retreats


  Once or twice a year the SSW guys and their families escape Sydney, Melbourne
  and Brisbane to attend SSW Retreats and spend some time together outside the
  office.


  During these getaways, we do a bunch of fun activities together, have a hearty
  and delicious meal, and take an epic walk someplace beautiful.
