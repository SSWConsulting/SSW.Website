  title: SSW Culture
  description: >
    SSW's company culture is rooted in .NET consultancy, Scrum methodologies,
    and software development best practices. Our "Make it happen" makes us one
    of the most effective, efficient, and innovative tech consultancies in
    Australia and beyond.
title: SSW Culture
subTitle: "A company's culture pervades everything a company does, and as such our reputation for delivering high quality software comes from the SSW culture. As one of Australia's longest-running .NET consultancies, SSW is mature but flexible, always evolving to include the best cumulative values, attitudes, standards, and beliefs of the employees.\n\nThough culture can be nebulous and changeable, it is a point of pride at SSW that our culture is always underpinned by the following:\n\n## \"Make it happen\"\n\nWe work together to provide solutions to problems for our clients every day, and this proactivity happens internally too.\n\nWe are effective and make sure our time counts.\n\nWe always leave meetings with clear action items and knowing what's expected from everyone.\n\nWe use [Scrum](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/scrum) extensively to help with prioritization and work transparency.\n\n## Appreciation\n\nWe understand that not everyone communicates and listens the same way, and that what's important to some may not be important to all. However, it is human to want to feel appreciated for our effort, so at SSW we keep this in mind when making an employee feel valued for their work.\n\nSee our interview with Kylie Hunt, workplace happiness guru, on the [5 languages of love](https://tv.ssw.com/6931/the-5-languages-of-appreciation-in-the-workplace-with-kylie-hunt).\n\n## Innovation\n\nKeeping on the cutting edge of technology, we're always looking out for the latest and greatest way of doing everything. We use the latest version of everything, sometime while it’s still in Beta (or even Alpha) stage. Being flexible and able to pivot as required means we’re ready for anything.\n\n## Consistency\n\nWe have documented all of the best practices we can possibly think of in our [Rules to Better 'Everything'](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules), and are always trying to make sure we're following and updating them whenever possible. We have also made a number of apps that enforce our coding standards in our work, such as [SSW Link Auditor](https://linkauditor.com.au/) and [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.codeauditor.com/).\n\nWe also have an extensive induction program built on [SugarLearning](https://www.sugarlearning.com/), which ensures we’re all on the same page with regards to our roles, rights, and responsibilities at the company. Each person who undertakes this induction is asked to provide feedback, to make sure the process is as fresh and accurate as possible.\n\n## Community involvement\n\nWe run multiple user groups including the [Sydney](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Sydney.aspx), [Melbourne](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Melbourne.aspx), and [Canberra](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Canberra.aspx) .NET User Groups, the [Brisbane](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Brisbane.aspx) Full Stack User Group and the Fire User Group in [Beijing and Hangzhou](https://fireusergroup.com/). We encourage as many of our employees as possible to share their tech passions by speaking at other User Groups and industry events such as Ignite, Build, NDC, etc.\n\nSSW also runs our own TV channel called [SSW TV](http://tv.ssw.com/), filled with content on the latest technologies. SSW TV encompasses everything from recordings of presentations and conferences, videos from our training courses, webinars, interviews and more. All content on SSW TV is available to anyone, 100% free, no sign up required.\n\n## SSW Brainstorming\n\nYour employees are your greatest asset, yet their valuable knowledge and insights often go unnoticed. Why not harness their creativity and problem-solving abilities by hosting a fun and collaborative Brainstorming day? It's a simple but effective way to unlock innovative ideas, foster team bonding, and empower your workforce. \U0001F9E0\U0001F4AA\n\nSSW has been running Brainstorming days for many years. Every time we improve process to ensure the attendees and the company are getting the most out of the day.\n\n<VideoEmbed url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov8OGcApBjc\" videoWidth=\"w-3/4\" removeMargin={true} uncentre={true} caption=\"Empowering Employees Through Brainstorming\" duration=\"3 min\" />\n\n## SSW Retreats\n\nOnce or twice a year the SSW guys and their families escape Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane to attend SSW Retreats and spend some time together outside the office.\n\nDuring these getaways, we do a bunch of fun activities together, have a hearty and delicious meal, and take an epic walk someplace beautiful.\n\n<VideoEmbed url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2aWUuqaEfU\" uncentre={true} videoWidth=\"w-3/4\" removeMargin={true} overflow={false} caption=\"SSW’s Brisbane Retreat 2023\" duration=\"2 min\" />\n\n***\n\nSee more videos on [SSW Employment page](https://www.ssw.com.au/employment).\n"
