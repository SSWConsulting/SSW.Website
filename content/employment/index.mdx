  # SSW Getaway / Retreat
  
  Once or twice a year the SSW guys and their families attend the SSW Getaway and spend some time together outside the office.

  During these getaways, we do a bunch of fun activities together, have a hearty and delicious meal, and take an epic walk someplace beautiful.
