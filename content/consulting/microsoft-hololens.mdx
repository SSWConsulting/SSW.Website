# Augmented reality in the modern workplace

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqFqtAJMtYE" caption="Introducing Microsoft HoloLens 2" duration="2 mins" />

Microsoft HoloLens, also known as "Project Baraboo", is a pair of mixed reality smart glasses developed by Microsoft. It is the first fully self-contained, holographic computer, enabling users to interact with high-definition holograms in real world. Never has there been a more exciting time to be on the forefront of technology, with HoloLens poised to be a major game-changer.

# Get hands on with the HoloLens 2

We've introduced some of Australia's top business leaders to this groundbreaking technology. Because it is an experience everybody should get, we are opening the offer to businesses interested in what HoloLens can do for them.
