        will help the development team keep track of every modification to the
        code. It allows the developers to compare previous versions of the code
        with the current one so that they can fix errors if a mistake is made.

# **Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)** in Action

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTpJNU-czHY" />

SSW has been developing software since 1990 and has perfected the art of delivering shippable code on budget and on time by using Agile techniques.

We use Microsoft's Visual Studio application lifecycle management (ALM) tools to provide the backbone for delivering software continuously. SSW can help you leverage the power of these tools to make your developers, testers, and analysts work together efficiently. We also use TFS, Microsoft Azure DevOps (was VSTS), TeamCity, and Octopus Deploy to fix your deployments and improve your testing lifecycle.
