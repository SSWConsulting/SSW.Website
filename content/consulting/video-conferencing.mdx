        Remote staff can efficiently complete their tasks using online
        collaboration tools. For example, it only takes one video conferencing
        application to enable remote training, team meetings, client meetings,
        and more, keeping your team productive while working from home.

        When running an online event, people can join you from anywhere! For
        example, if you’re selling training, there’s a good chance you will have
        a higher attendance rate online than in-person. As an event can also be
        recorded, paying attendees don’t even need to be available during the
        live recording – they can also view it at their leisure, or even more
        than once.

        Travel can be a barrier to many staff and customers who would like to
        attend your conferences and events. Removing this barrier by moving your

        you and your attendees.

# The benefits of video conferencing

##### Video conferencing provides a number of opportunities to businesses. It can be used to engage remote teams and employees working from home; to promote collaboration across the team; to run webinars, live events or live-stream in-person events to remote attendees; to meet clients; or even to interview job candidates. SSW can help you identify these opportunities and set up a system that will help you achieve your goal.
