        The periodic Scrum meeting promotes transparency for both development
        progress and process. It provides a clear view for all team members of
        what activities are on-going and how well the whole project is
        performing.

      description: >
        Working with the Scrum methodology, it is much easier for managers to
        get clear inspections of the project periodically. Therefore, any time
        the project is not going according to plan, the managers will be able to
        react quickly.

        In a real project development situation, things may not always go
        according to plan. The Scrum methodology is a perfect solution for
        adapting to change. It allows all the team members to be aware of any
        changes as soon as possible. It also provides an ideal communication
        environment between the Product Owner and the developers.

        Instead of keeping the client waiting until the final design is
        deployed, Scrum allows the client to have a clear image of how well the
        project is going. This will improve the satisfaction level of the client
        both during the project and afterwards.

# **Scrum** explained

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOvFK328C_Q" caption="8 Steps To Scrum - Scrum Explained" duration="4 mins" />

Scrum is an Agile Software Development methodology. Focusing on communication, the goal of Scrum is effective delivery of complex software projects. It does this by using regular, scheduled, incremental releases (weekly Sprints).

Customers are closely involved in the process and are encouraged to review and change priorities, based on their changing business needs and users' feedback:

1. **Daily - A 15-minute Daily Scrum meeting**
2. **Weekly - Timeboxed meetings with the client at the start and end of each Sprint**
3. Every work item - A\*\* clear "Definition of Done" to ensure work follows the Acceptance Criteria\*\*

The client (also known as the Product Owner) re-prioritizes tasks at the beginning of each Sprint so that the Scrum team is always working on the most important features.

Each team has a dedicated Scrum Master who is accountable for removing impediments that the team may face.

Lastly, the Development Team is a self-organized team that consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.
