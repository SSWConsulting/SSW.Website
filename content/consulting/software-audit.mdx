      description: >
        Architectural decisions have a great impact on the subsequent quality of
        software implementations. Is your system using the most appropriate
        technology? Is the system designed for future needs, not only for
        today's deadlines?

      title: DEVOPS AND ALM REVIEW
      description: >
        We use Microsoft's Visual Studio application lifecycle management (ALM)
        tools to provide the backbone for delivering software continuously. SSW
        can help you leverage the power of these tools to make your developers,
        testers, and analysts work together efficiently. We also use TFS, Azure
        DevOps (was VSTS), TeamCity, and Octopus Deploy to fix your deployments
        and improve your testing lifecycle.

      title: SPECIFICATION REVIEW
      description: >
        Instead of keeping the client waiting until the final design is
        deployed,  Scrum allows the client to have a clear image of how well the
        project is going.  This will improve the satisfaction level of the
        client both during the project  and afterwards.

        Is your team as effective and efficient as possible? Without proper team
        processes, your project will suffer and deadlines will be missed. SSW
        experts have streamlined processes for hundreds of projects and know

      title: USER INTERFACE REVIEW
      description: >
        Most users don't read manuals, so your software must be intuitive and
        consistent. Establishing consistency in your User Interface design is
        challenging. There are many standards available, but too often
        developers and application designers unknowingly choose a non-standard
        approach.

      description: >
        Your website is your point of presence on the Internet. It's great to
        have a good website but there is no point to this unless people can find
        it. The number 1 way to reach new clients is through search engines, in
        particular Google, which claims to be used by 70% of Internet users.

      title: DATABASE STRUCTURE REVIEW
      description: >
        Designing a database incorrectly means a real headache later on. Your
        database could be the bottleneck in your application, if it is not
        designed well it can slow the application right down. We will review all
        your database objects to check for weaknesses, as well as common
        mistakes that developers make.We focus on performance issues, removing
        data duplication and ensuring data integrity.

        SSW can provide a performance review of your application to target
        specific areas for improvements. You specify the number of simultaneous
        users and set performance goals, for example \<2 second average response
        time.We will then analyze your database query design, system
        architecture and code structure to provide you with a set of
        recommendations and specifications.

## Benefits of Software Auditing

A crisis will pinpoint the shortfalls of your current technologies. Why wait for down-time or poor sales to discover where your application could be improved?

The companies that we have done audits for range from developer utilities to major enterprise systems.

## How long does this normally take?
