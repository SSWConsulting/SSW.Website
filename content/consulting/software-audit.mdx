      title: ARCHITECTURE AND BACKEND WEB API REVIEW
      description: >
        Architectural decisions have a great impact on the subsequent quality of
        software implementations. Is your system using the most appropriate
        technology? Is the system designed for future needs, not only for
        today's deadlines?

      title: DEVOPS AND ALM REVIEW
      description: >
        We use Microsoft's Visual Studio application lifecycle management (ALM)
        tools to provide the backbone for delivering software continuously. SSW
        can help you leverage the power of these tools to make your developers,
        testers, and analysts work together efficiently. We also use TFS, Azure
        DevOps (was VSTS), TeamCity, and Octopus Deploy to fix your deployments
        and improve your testing lifecycle.

      title: SPECIFICATION REVIEW

      title: TEAM AND PROCESS REVIEW
      description: >
        Is your team as effective and efficient as possible? Without proper team
        processes, your project will suffer and deadlines will be missed. SSW
        experts have streamlined processes for hundreds of projects and know

      title: USER INTERFACE REVIEW
      description: >
        Most users don't read manuals, so your software must be intuitive and
        consistent. Establishing consistency in your User Interface design is
        challenging. There are many standards available, but too often
        developers and application designers unknowingly choose a non-standard
        approach.

      title: GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION
      description: >
        Your website is your point of presence on the Internet. It's great to
        have a good website but there is no point to this unless people can find
        it. The number 1 way to reach new clients is through search engines, in
        particular Google, which claims to be used by 70% of Internet users.

      title: DATABASE STRUCTURE REVIEW
      description: >
        Designing a database incorrectly means a real headache later on. Your
        database could be the bottleneck in your application, if it is not
        designed well it can slow the application right down. We will review all
        your database objects to check for weaknesses, as well as common
        mistakes that developers make.We focus on performance issues, removing
        data duplication and ensuring data integrity.

        architecture and code structure to provide you with a set of
        recommendations and specifications.
