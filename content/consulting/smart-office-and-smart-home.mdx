          title: Convenience
          description: When the first person arrives, disarm and unlock the front door, unlock internal doors, turn on lights, raise the blinds and turn on the air conditioner. Then welcome with that person's favorite music (One day the coffee will be brewed too!). If you have a presentation, you can even set it to turn the projector on, drop the screen, dim the light and turn up the speakers.

# Discover the benefits of **automation systems**

The term "smart" is used to describe many different things. Essentially, an office or house becomes smart when its many systems (lights, climate control, music, blinds, air conditioners etc) are tied together under a master control system that can perform automated tasks. The system is accessible from your phone, from anywhere.

The automation systems SSW offer allows you to control all electronic systems and with the touch of a button when you are ready to give a presentation or watch a movie. Watch the lights dim, your blinds close, your thermostat adjusts to your most comfortable temperature and your movie starts!

We offer all types of smart home possibilities, including solutions from Control4 and Nest. Our system design experts will find the solution that best fits your needs and your budget, while our experienced installers will make everything come to life. Best of all it will be easy to use. Say goodbye to the days of having a pile of remote controls sitting on your living room table!
