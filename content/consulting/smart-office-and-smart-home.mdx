        When the first person arrives, disarm and unlock the front door, unlock
        internal doors, turn on lights, raise the blinds and turn on the air
        conditioner. Then welcome with that person's favorite music (One day the
        coffee will be brewed too!). If you have a presentation, you can even
        set it to turn the projector on, drop the screen, dim the light and turn
        up the speakers.

        Just arrived home or office, one touch on a Control4 remote or your
        smartphone, sets the perfect lighting level. You can set a path of
        lights to welcome you, every time you open the garage door or your main
        office door. Control lights at home while you are away. You’ll be able
        to select a personalized button labelled "goodnight" before bedtime,
        that shuts off all house lights and turns on an outside light.

# Discover the benefits of **automation systems**

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmo5YQbVxH4" />

The term "smart" is used to describe many different things. Essentially, an office or house becomes smart when its many systems (lights, climate control, music, blinds, air conditioners etc) are tied together under a master control system that can perform automated tasks. The system is accessible from your phone, from anywhere.

The automation systems SSW offer allows you to control all electronic systems and with the touch of a button when you are ready to give a presentation or watch a movie. Watch the lights dim, your blinds close, your thermostat adjusts to your most comfortable temperature and your movie starts!

We offer all types of smart home possibilities, including solutions from Control4 and Nest. Our system design experts will find the solution that best fits your needs and your budget, while our experienced installers will make everything come to life. Best of all it will be easy to use. Say goodbye to the days of having a pile of remote controls sitting on your living room table!
