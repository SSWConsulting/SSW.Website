      title: SIMPLE INTEGRATION
      description: >
        Vue.js is based on JavaScript and it can be easily integrated into other
        applications built on JavaScript. It means Vue is useful for developing
        new web applications as well as altering the pre-existing applications.
        This integration is possible because Vue.js has components for
        everything.

      description: >
        Shipping your product early and often to production means that you will
        get feedback from your users faster and that you can rapidly improve it.
        Vue.js makes it very easy to start off and initiating coding - which
        means that a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) can be made a lot quicker than
        in any other framework.

      title: FLEXIBILITY
      description: >
        Vue.js is flexible and scalable. It was built in a way that it can be
        used in a big number of environments, and even inside other JavaScript,
        PHP and other frameworks. You can add it to pre-existing projects in a
        lot of technologies, start a website, web applications or even a native
        app. It removes limitations and ensures stability. Also, you can use
        Vue.js for simple and complex projects.

      title: SIZE-EFFICIENT
      description: >
        Vue.js apps are smaller in size (so they are quicker to load and use
        less bandwidth) and typically more performant than equivalent
        applications built in other frameworks. Vue also takes care of a lot of
        optimizations on its own, so there's no need to worry about tweaking the
        application as it grows. It means there will be more time available to
        focus on adding new and value-oriented features to it. Finally, it also
        means that Vue apps are scalable: it's relatively easy to take them from
        a simple one-page app to an advanced system, being used by hundreds of
        thousands of users, like Alibaba website.

# The benefits of using **Vue.js**

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1iLqZnZPdo" caption="Why 43% of Front-End Developers want to learn Vue.js" duration="6 mins" />

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework to build web interfaces and applications. It is becoming a more and more popular framework for simplifying web development. Vue.js can be incrementally adopted - you can start with the view layer only and scale it to power sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with the modern tooling and support libraries.

With Vue.js, you can basically write an app very fast and run it straight from the browser - you also have the option to build a complex application using ES6, JSX, routing, Vuex and more, according to your project. We can help you cut out through the knowledge path and get your app quickly up and running.
