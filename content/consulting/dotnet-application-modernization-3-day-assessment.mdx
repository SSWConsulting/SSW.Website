## Formulate Your Modernization Strategy with Expert Insights

Understanding the scope, requirements, and any potential challenges is crucial before beginning your application modernization journey. SSW’s .NET Application Modernization Assessment and Scoping service provides you with a detailed blueprint and roadmap, enabling you to make informed decisions about your project's future.

Our assessment and scoping offering is designed to thoroughly evaluate your existing .NET web application and help you devise a phased plan to migrate to .NET 8, enabling better integration with Azure's cloud infrastructure.

### Why .NET 8?

\- The latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of the platform – migrating now will futureproof your application.

\- Providing robust enterprise functionality and cloud-native development all within a stable ecosystem backed by Microsoft.

\- Offering the ultimate developer experience for your team, with state-of-the-art features like C# 12, Native AOT (Ahead of Time Compilation), and source code generation.

\- With exceptional performance, with faster response times and lower compute power requirements compared to other popular frameworks.

\- Trusted and secure, Microsoft quickly releases updates when threats are discovered.

\- Boasting a large ecosystem, with over 5,000,000 .NET developers worldwide, providing access to a vast array of libraries and community support through the NuGet package manager and Visual Studio Marketplace.

### Our phased migration approach:

1\. **ASSESSMENT:** Assessing your current solutions and their features in a Specification Review.

2\. **STRATEGY: **Gauging the appropriate strategy based on your needs and priorities (Strangler Fig or Big Bang).

3\. **PLAN: **For each component, either:  

   \- Refactor: modernize the code to run with .NET 8

   \- Replace: find a product with the same functionality

   \- Rewrite: if no equivalent exists, rewrite from scratch

4\. **MIGRATE:** Executing the migration in a safe and controlled manner, minimizing disruption and mitigating risk.

5\. **OPTIMIZE:** Provide post-migration support and check-in to ensure your software performs as expected.
