## Revitalize .NET Apps with Expert Migration to .NET 8 and Azure

Is your .NET application slowing you down? Transform your business with a .NET modernization assessment. We'll help you revitalize both your web and mobile apps.

Understanding the complexities of modernizing applications is crucial. Our expert team provides a detailed roadmap to guide your journey from .NET to .NET 8, optimizing for Azure cloud integration.

### Why .NET 8?

\- The latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of the platform â€“ migrating now will futureproof your application.

\- Providing robust enterprise functionality and cloud-native development all within a stable ecosystem backed by Microsoft.

\- Offering the ultimate developer experience for your team, with state-of-the-art features like C# 12, Native AOT (Ahead of Time Compilation), and source code generation.

\- With exceptional performance, with faster response times and lower compute power requirements compared to other popular frameworks.

\- Trusted and secure, Microsoft quickly releases updates when threats are discovered.

\- Boasting a large ecosystem, with over 5,000,000 .NET developers worldwide, providing access to a vast array of libraries and community support through the NuGet package manager and Visual Studio Marketplace.

### Our phased migration approach:

1\. **ASSESSMENT:** Assessing your current solutions and their features in a Specification Review.

2\. **STRATEGY:** Gauging the appropriate strategy based on your needs and priorities (Strangler Fig or Big Bang).

3\. **PLAN:** For each component, either:

\- **Refactor:** modernize the code to run with .NET 8

\- **Replace:** find a product with the same functionality

\- **Rewrite:** if no equivalent exists, rewrite from scratch

4\. **MIGRATE:** Executing the migration in a safe and controlled manner, minimizing disruption and mitigating risk.

5\. **OPTIMIZE:** Provide post-migration support and check-in to ensure your software performs as expected.
