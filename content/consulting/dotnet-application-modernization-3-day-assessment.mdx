## The Risks of Running Applications on Outdated .NET Frameworks

Running applications on outdated .NET frameworks poses significant risks and limitations that can hinder your business's growth and security. Older frameworks often lack support for modern development practices, leading to inefficiencies, slower performance, and increased maintenance costs. These legacy systems are more vulnerable to security threats, as they may no longer receive timely updates and patches from Microsoft. Additionally, they struggle to integrate with newer technologies, such as cloud services and advanced development tools, limiting your ability to innovate and scale. Migrating to the latest .NET framework, like .NET 8, ensures your applications are secure, performant, and capable of leveraging the latest technological advancements, positioning your business for future success.

## Revitalize .NET Apps with Expert Migration to .NET 8 and Azure

Is your .NET application slowing you down? Transform your business with a .NET modernization assessment. We'll help you revitalize both your web and mobile apps.

Understanding the complexities of modernizing applications is crucial. Our expert team provides a detailed roadmap to guide your journey from .NET to .NET 8, optimizing for Azure cloud integration.

### Why .NET 8?

.NET 8 is the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version, making it the optimal choice for future-proofing your applications. It offers robust enterprise functionality, enabling cloud-native development within a secure, Microsoft-backed ecosystem. With cutting-edge features like C# 12, Native AOT (Ahead of Time Compilation), and source code generation, .NET 8 delivers unparalleled performance, reducing compute power needs and enhancing response times. Supported by a vast developer community, it provides access to extensive libraries and tools via NuGet and Visual Studio Marketplace, ensuring a strong foundation for your development needs.

### Our phased migration approach:

1\. **ASSESSMENT:** Assessing your current solutions and their features in a Specification Review.

2\. **STRATEGY:** Gauging the appropriate strategy based on your needs and priorities (Strangler Fig or Big Bang).

3\. **PLAN:** For each component, either:

\- **Refactor:** modernize the code to run with .NET 8

\- **Replace:** find a product with the same functionality

\- **Rewrite:** if no equivalent exists, rewrite from scratch

4\. **MIGRATE:** Executing the migration in a safe and controlled manner, minimizing disruption and mitigating risk.

5\. **OPTIMIZE:** Provide post-migration support and check-in to ensure your software performs as expected.
