      title: C# OR JAVASCRIPT? HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
      description: >-
        C# is a well-known strongly typed programming language which means you
        can catch errors at compile time. Blazor allow using pre-compiled C#
        with access to all our favourite NuGet packages. You can still use
        JavaScript to pull in any npm package and expose it to your C# Blazor
        Components.

# The benefits of using **Blazor**

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oeh2IJw7Zig`

Blazor is a powerful C#-based frontend SPA (Single Page Application) framework from Microsoft. Blazor applications are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript (if needed). Blazor supports the use of C# .NET Shared Libraries, so you can share the exact same code between both client and server applications. You can even use .NET code or packages that were written before Blazor existed! Amazing returns on your development efforts!
