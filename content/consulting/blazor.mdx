# The benefits of using **Blazor** 

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oeh2IJw7Zig`

Blazor is a powerful C#-based frontend SPA (Single Page Application) framework from Microsoft. Blazor applications are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript (if needed). Blazor supports the use of C# .NET Shared Libraries, so you can share the exact same code between both client and server applications. You can even use .NET code or packages that were written before Blazor existed! Amazing returns on your development efforts!
