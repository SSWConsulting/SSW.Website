# The benefits of **Microsoft SharePoint**

<VideoEmbed url="https://youtu.be/57t_o0Bspdk" />

Organizations are extremely good at accumulating data. Mostly in the form of documents and records, this data is often haphazardly located across the organization, and poorly integrated into document processes.

##### SharePoint aims to improve the situation by storing all documents & records in a centralized system. They can store every version of a document, allow you to enforce information management policies, and improve efficiency by automating common business processes.
