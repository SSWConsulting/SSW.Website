## The Risks of Not Using Identity and Access Management

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is critical for securing your organization’s data by ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive resources. Without solutions like Microsoft Entra ID, businesses are exposed to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compliance issues. Hackers can exploit weak controls, leading to data theft and financial loss. Internally, employees might access information beyond their roles, increasing misuse risks. Implementing IAM with features like multi-factor authentication (MFA), conditional access, and identity governance mitigates these threats and ensures compliance with industry standards. Neglecting IAM leaves businesses vulnerable to both internal and external threats.
