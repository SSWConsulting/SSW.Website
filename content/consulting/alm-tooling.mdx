      description: >
        As an important part of application lifecycle management, source control
        will help the development team keep track of every modification to the
        code. It allows the developers to compare previous versions of the code
        with the current one so that they can fix errors if a mistake is made.

        are working as productively as they can.

Since 1990, SSW has excelled in delivering quality software on time and within budget, utilizing Agile methodologies for optimal results.

Our development process is powered by Microsoft's Visual Studio ALM tools, fostering collaboration across development, testing, and analysis. We ensure a seamless journey from code to deployment, improving your software delivery and testing lifecycle with the latest technologies such as TFS, Azure DevOps, TeamCity, and Octopus Deploy.

In the realm of source code management and infrastructure as code, we leverage Bicep for streamlined Azure deployments, GitHub Actions for automated workflows, and platforms like Bitbucket and GitHub for robust code management, ensuring that our DevOps strategies are comprehensive and cutting-edge.
