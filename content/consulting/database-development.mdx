      description: >-
        Capitalize on the high flexibility of Microsoft SQL Server, once the
        database is built, it could be deployed to many different platforms,
        such as in the cloud servers, on premises, and to edge devices without
        changing the original database.

      title: BUILT-IN INTELLIGENCE
      description: >-
        There is a built-in intelligence called "Azure" inside Microsoft SQL
        Server. It makes building intelligent applications become much easier
        for developers. Take advantage of a rich set of cognitive APIs to easily
        build new experiences into your applications for human-like
        intelligences.

      title: POWERFUL SECURITY FEATURES
      description: >-
        The Microsoft SQL Server uses policy-based management to detect security
        policies that are non-compliant. This feature allows only authorized
        personnel access to the database. Even better, all security audits and
        events can be written to log files automatically.

      title: ENHANCED PERFORMANCE
      description: >-
        With the built-in transparent data compression and encryption features,
        the developers do not need to modify or change their programs to encrypt
        data. Meanwhile, the Microsoft SQL Server also has efficient access
        control and permission management tools so that the performance of data
        collection is much better than that of many other database management
        systems.
