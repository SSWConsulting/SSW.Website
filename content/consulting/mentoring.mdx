      title: HIGH FLEXIBILITY
      description: >+
        You can choose a mentor from any technology including SharePoint, .NET,
        Web Services, SQL Server and Business intelligence. SSW mentors can work
        on your terms or can be an on-call service when required.

      title: LEARN WHILE WORKING
      description: >
        Unlike hiring an expert just to work for you on a single project, SSW
        mentors will teach your team and work on your project at the same time.
        The mentoring service will encourage reflections on practices so that
        your team can work on their own in the future.

      title: LONG-TERM SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIP
      description: >+
        Instead of finishing and leaving, SSW mentors will develop a long-term
        supportive relationship with your company. If you have any further
        issue, we are willing to help.

      title: MORE THAN TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS
      description: >
        Each SSW mentor is also a Scrum Master. They can teach you how to run
        your team as a Scrum team. Instead of only providing solutions for
        technology issues, we also teach you how to work with efficiency.

# SSWÂ Mentoring Services

<VideoEmbed url="https://youtu.be/iQ0ujXPVSOc" />

##### If you have a team of developers who need to learn a new technology for a project, then SSW mentoring is the best way to get them up to speed and delivering working functionality.

##### Our mentoring program allows your team to work alongside a highly skilled SSW software architect to not just train your staff, but work with them as part of the team, to deliver your project outcomes.


Typically, the SSW mentor will work closely with the team during the first sprint, helping them set up their project, architecting their solution and writing the first lines of code. You can decide how long the mentor stays to assist and what level of assistance is required.
