# Why do you need **Windows desktop Applications**?

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ja4nZnwh4" />

Windows is a powerful platform for creating rich media and line-of-business applications. Internal applications with rich data and interactivity have been at the core of the modern business for many years. SSW has been creating desktop applications on the Windows platforms for over 15 years and has a wealth of experience to draw on. Since then, we have been focusing on the 2 main technologies of Windows 10 desktop applications, which are Windows 10 store applications, and the more traditional WPF for classically styled applications.
