# Acquire more clients using **PPC campaigns**

![PPC campaigns](/images/benefits/ppc-bigbanner.png)

Pay Per Click (Search Engine Marketing) advertising has come a long way in the last few years. Businesses are now able to target their prospects based on their interests and actions on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. LinkedIn allows you to quickly put your message in front of professionals and even target them using their job roles or industry, for example. Twitter will let you target lookalike profiles of people who follow a digital influencer, specific keywords, or conversation topics that they are interested in. Each platform will allow you to action and perform different strategies that your business might require.

Google Ads is still going strong and is still the powerhouse of Pay Per Click advertising, but many companies are getting a much better return on investment from Facebook or Instagram Ads. It all depends on what you sell, your strategy and your brand power. We have been able to pay for leads from our target audience for as little as $1.25 per lead.

1. Are you getting a good Return On Investment from your Pay Per Click advertising?
2. Are you using the data collected by the platforms to optimise your campaigns to increase conversions?
