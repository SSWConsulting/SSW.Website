##### More often than not businesses take their data and data protection for granted. It is an easy oversite when your business is running smoothly and quickly. Loss of large amounts of data can cause a business to struggle to recover and in a lot of cases shut down completely.

##### Backblaze has introduced a simple backup system utilizing B2 Cloud Storage which is cheap, requires little on premises infrastructure and fast to setup.

##### SSW can assist in the design and implementation of a Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan to meet your business requirements.
