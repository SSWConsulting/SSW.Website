# Overview

SSW appreciates that strategic architecture is not about implementing the latest technology trend, but rather gaining understanding of the key demands that other business units are placing on IT, and defining a prioritized roadmap to address these key demands. By working with the CIO, SSW can use the deep and wide experience of our consultants to help craft the direction for IT investments over the medium and longer timeframes to maximize return on investment and achieve key stakeholder buy-in.
