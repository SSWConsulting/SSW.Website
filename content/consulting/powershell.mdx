# The benefits of automating everything in your infrastructure with PowerShell and SSW

System Administrators, Site Reliability Engineers and Automation Engineers
across the globe love to automate every possible task, and PowerShell is the
answer for on-premises and cloud automation, as it is an open-source,
cross-platform scripting language and command-line shell that can be used on and
with Azure. PowerShell scripting is the fastest and best way to get your routine
tasks done automatically e.g. managing Virtual Machines, Servers, employee
onboarding and offboarding process, certificate management and much more.
