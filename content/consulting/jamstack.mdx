      title: CUTTING COSTS / EASY SCALING
      description: >
        Hosting static files is cheap, and since there are no databases or
        servers, there's no need to handle load balancers, and the CDN can
        manage the scaling process.

      title: BETTER DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE
      description: >
        Since the entire site content is static, it can be managed through
        version control. Tracking change history becomes more straightforward,
        and updating the site is as easy as uploading a new copy of the site and
        invalidating the cache.

# What isÂ **Jamstack**?

Jamstack is a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs and prebuilt Markup. Static Site generators - like Gatsby and Next.js - take raw content from various inputs (Markdown files, WordPress, GitHub etc.) and produce a set of static HTML pages at build time. The pre-rendered HTML pages can then be deployed and served directly to the user from a CDN. In addition, static pages are enhanced with JavaScript and APIs (custom-built or 3rd party) for dynamic functionalities like authentication, search, logging.
