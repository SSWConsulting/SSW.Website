# Get started on **Home Offices**

Amidst current health concerns of Coronavirus (COVID-19), it is important to have an approach for allowing people to start working from home. SSW can assist in putting the tools in place to allow your employees to continue working with little to no impact on their efficiency and productivity.

# **Remote work** is here to stay

Workspaces have been becoming more flexible for some time and the COVID-19 crisis has only accelerated the adoption of the technologies that enable this.

In addition to the specific devastating economic impact this pandemic has already had on the retail, hospitality, and tourism sectors, industries with more limited exposure are also having to radically alter the way they operate. SSW is a specialist in transformative tech solutions and if your business needs help to adapt to the COVID-19 crisis, we can help you to thrive in this new paradigm.

Here are a few ways we can help your business:

* Urgent bug fixes – If you are directly involved in the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis you are our priority – We will make sure you can continue to provide essential services by providing bug fixes to websites, intranets, portals, databases and other systems that are essential to your operations
* Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery – SSW can help you to plan and implement procedures and systems to help you to continue operating throughout and after crises including the COVID-19 pandemic
* Plan and implement Office 365 cloud migration to enable your people to access the data they need to work from home effectively
* Keep your staff connected via Teams, Skype, Zoom or Google Hangouts
* Design systems to help you to promote and sell your products online including setup and configuration of chatbots
* Add a Scrum Master to help remote teams to become more productive
* Develop remotely accessible custom cloud applications for any of your business needs
* Automate labour-intensive business processes using IoT and the Microsoft Power Platform
* Provide training in livestreaming and video production to enable you to move your in-person content online
* Provide training via a virtual academy to upskill your staff in online technologies

[See our Remote Work rules](https://rules.ssw.com.au/rules-to-better-remote-work) for best practices for working from home.

At SSW we are fortunate that our experience in online technology makes it easier for us to adapt our work practices to a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and because of this, SSW stands ready to help your business adapt to this new environment as well. Because we are always sharing and encouraging collaboration on solutions to technological problems, we’ve created some handy Rules to Better Remote Work to help you and your team adapt to an online workspace, and our own Chief Architect and Microsoft Regional Director, Adam Cogan, has also produced a video on how to prepare yourself for remote work.

Contact us for a free 1-hour consultation and we will help you to find solutions that work both technically and financially in these uncertain times.
