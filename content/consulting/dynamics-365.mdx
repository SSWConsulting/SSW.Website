Managing your client relationships is easy with Dynamics 365. It combines
existing Microsoft products such as Dynamics CRM, Dynamics NAV, and Dynamics AX
into one seamless solution. These components work together to allow your company
to track customers across the whole life cycle of their interaction with you.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 brings new levels of customer intelligence, providing
every customer-facing employee the information they need to truly impress
customers.

You no longer need to worry about maintaining data across your CRM (Customer
Relationship Management) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems as all
the information is seamlessly integrated.

Microsoft Dynamics 365 allows you to select only the components you need and
comes in two versions (Enterprise - More than 250 employees, and Business - 10
to 250 employees) so the possibilities for organisations large and small are
limitless.
