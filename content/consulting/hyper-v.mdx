# The benefits of usingÂ Hyper-V

##### Optimize your server hardware investments by consolidating multiple server roles as separate virtual machines running on a single physical machine. Also leveraging Failover Cluster Manager multiple physical machines running Hyper-V can be linked allowing for real time failover of virtual machines to another physical device

SSW can assist in the design and implementation of an Infrastructure that will be stable, fast, scalable and be capable of hosting multiple virtual machines on consolidated hardware.
