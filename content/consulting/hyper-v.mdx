# The benefits of using Hyper-V

Hyper-V and Azure Virtual Machines offer numerous advantages for optimizing server hardware investments and providing a stable, scalable infrastructure. By leveraging Hyper-V, you can consolidate multiple server roles as separate virtual machines running on a single physical machine. This consolidation maximizes the utilization of your server hardware, allowing for cost savings and efficient resource allocation.

SSW can assist in the design and implementation of a robust infrastructure that incorporates Hyper-V and Azure Virtual Machines. Our expertise ensures stability, speed, scalability, and the capability to host multiple virtual machines on consolidated hardware. Furthermore, we can also help with the deployment of virtual desktops, allowing for remote work environments that are flexible, secure, and accessible from anywhere.
