# The benefits of implementingÂ **DPM**

Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager can take the stress and management overhead out of backups by allowing you to control all your backups from one central console. Data Protection Manager allows the backup of Windows Server, SQL Databases, Exchange Server, SharePoint and also allows for the use of local or cloud storage.

SSW can assist in the design and implementation of Data Protection Manager as well as reviewing your current Disaster Recovery Plan.
