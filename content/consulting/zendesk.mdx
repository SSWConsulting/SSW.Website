# The benefits of using **Zendesk**

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1HlAsW1RiA" caption="The Zendesk Omnichannel Approach" duration="1 min" />

Most organisations start off using a simple email inbox for support queries, and have a phone number for more complex issues that require a call, but the modern customer wants to be able to contact you by phone, email, social media, SMS, etc., and have the conversation continue seamlessly, regardless of who may take on the support request. As your organisation scales, this becomes a challenge… enter Zendesk.
