## Risks of Using Outdated .NET Frameworks

Using outdated .NET frameworks exposes your applications to several risks that can impact your business’s performance and security. Older frameworks lack modern development support, which can cause inefficiencies, slower performance, and higher maintenance costs. They are also more vulnerable to security threats, as Microsoft may no longer provide timely updates and patches. Additionally, outdated frameworks struggle to connect with new technologies, such as cloud services and advanced development tools, which limits your ability to innovate and scale. Upgrading to the latest .NET framework, like .NET 8, helps keep your applications secure, improves performance, and enables you to use the latest technology, preparing your business for future growth.

## Revitalize .NET Apps with .NET 8 and Azure Migration

Is your .NET application holding back your business? Modernize with our .NET assessment to boost performance for both web and mobile apps. Our expert team simplifies the migration process, providing a clear roadmap to upgrade your apps from .NET to .NET 8, with full optimization for Azure cloud integration.

### Why Choose .NET 8?

.NET 8 is the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version, making it ideal for securing your application’s future. It supports enterprise-level features for cloud-native development within a reliable, Microsoft-backed environment. With new capabilities like C# 12, Native AOT (Ahead of Time Compilation), and source code generation, .NET 8 boosts performance, lowers compute requirements, and improves response times. Backed by a large developer community, it provides access to extensive libraries and tools through NuGet and the Visual Studio Marketplace, giving you a solid foundation for all your development needs.

### Our phased migration approach:

1\. **ASSESSMENT:** Review your current solutions and features in a Specification Review.

2\. **STRATEGY:** Choose the best migration strategy based on your needs (Strangler Fig or Big Bang).

3\. **PLAN:** Decide on an approach for each component:

\- **Refactor:** Update code to work with .NET 8

\- **Replace:** Find a product with similar functionality

\- **Rewrite:** Create new code if no equivalent exists

4\. **MIGRATE:** Perform the migration in a safe, controlled way to reduce disruption and risk.

5\. **OPTIMIZE:** Offer post-migration support to ensure your software runs smoothly.
