      title: SERVER-SIDE RENDERING
      description: >
        Next.js provides automatic static optimisation to render your React 
        application on the server to static HTML.

      title: SEO FRIENDLY
      description: >
        Compared to a client-side rendered single page application (SPA), Next.js
        has much better SEO capabilities. This is because the page is pre-rendered to 
        HTML, instead of using JavaScript to insert elements onto the page, which runs
        on the user's browser.

      title: API ROUTES
      description: >
        Next.js allows for the quick and easy creation of API routes via file-based routing to handle server-side
        logic. This allows for the fast creation of a backend API without the need
        for a separate backend server. Its as easy as creating a file in the API 
        folder, and exporting a function. It is syntactically similar to Express.js, 
        so if you have used Express.js before, you will feel right at home.

      title: EDGE RUNTIME
      description: >
        Next.js APIs can optionally be deployed to the edge, meaning that API functionality
        can be run on the edge, instead of on a Node.js server where your web app is deployed.

      title: REACT SERVER COMPONENTS
      description: >
        The new app directory architecture introduced in Next.js 13 introduced a 
        brand new paradigm to create React components. React Server Components 
        means you can now run React components on the server with a Node.js runtime,
        meaning you can now run server-side logic in your React components.
