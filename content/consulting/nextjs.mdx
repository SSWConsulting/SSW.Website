      title: API ROUTES
      description: >
        Next.js allows for the quick and easy creation of API routes via file-based routing to handle server-side
        logic. This allows for the fast creation of a backend API without the need
        for a separate backend server. Its as easy as creating a file in the API 
        folder, and exporting a function. It is syntactically similar to Express.js, 
        so if you have used Express.js before, you will feel right at home.
