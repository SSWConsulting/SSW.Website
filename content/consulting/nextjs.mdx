      title: SERVER-SIDE RENDERING
      description: >
        Next.js provides automatic static optimisation to render your React 
        application on the server to static HTML.

      title: SEO FRIENDLY
      description: >
        Compared to a client-side rendered single page application (SPA), Next.js
        has much better SEO capabilities. Next.js uses automatic static optimisation to sender React to 
        static HTML, instead of using JavaScript to insert elements onto the page.

      title: API ROUTES
      description: >
        Next.js allows for the quick and easy creation of API routes via file-based routing to handle server-side
        logic. This allows for the fast creation of a backend API without the need
        for a separate backend server. Its as easy as creating a file in the API 
        folder, and exporting a function. It is syntactically similar to Express.js, 
        so if you have used Express.js before, you will feel right at home.

      title: EDGE RUNTIME
      description: >
        Next.js APIs can optionally be deployed to the edge, meaning that API functionality
        can be run on a server close to the end-user, instead of on a Node.js 
        server where your web app is deployed. This can massively speed up latency 
        for your API calls, and speed up your web app.

      title: REACT SERVER COMPONENTS
      description: >
        The new app directory architecture introduced in Next.js 13 introduced a 
        brand new paradigm to create React components. React Server Components 
        means you can now run React components on the server with a Node.js runtime,
        meaning you can now run server-side logic in your React components.

      title: AUTOMATIC OPTIMISATION
      description: >
        Next.js has built in automatic optimisation of images, fonts, and CSS.
