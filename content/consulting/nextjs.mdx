# Why build your web app with **Next.js**?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a wide range of useful features for your web app,
such as server-side rendering, automatic optimization, and API routes. It has become one of the
industry-leading frameworks for building performant and scalable React-based web apps.

Next.js' server-side rendering means that data can be fetched ahead of time, and doesn't
need to be loaded by the client. Unlike client-side rendered single-page applications
(SPAs) like React and Angular, Next.js can generate static HTML pages that are easily
indexable by search engines, helping improve your web app's discoverability.

The ability to easily spin up API routes also means that you may not need to set up
a dedicated backend server for your web app. It's as easy as creating a file in the API
folder, and exporting a function. It is syntactically similar to Express.js, which
makes it accessible and intuitive for developers.

Next.js also is one of the first frameworks to implement React Server Components,
which allows you to run React components on the server with a Node.js runtime. This
means that expensive JavaScript operations can be run on the server, resulting in
better UX and a smaller JavaScript bundle size.

Next.js has been the tool of choice for a wide range of organizations, including
Netflix, Twitch, Reddit, GitHub, TikTok, Notion and more. See some great examples
of Next.js apps at [nextjs.org/showcase](https://nextjs.org/showcase).

When it comes to building performant and scalable web apps, Next.js is a top choice.
Its powerful features, including SSR, API routing, and React Server Components, along
with its endorsement by industry giants, make it an awesome choice for your web app.
