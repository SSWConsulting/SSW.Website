# The benefits of **Power BI**

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKTSLffVGbk" />

Power BI is a cloud based business analytics service, allowing anyone to visualize and analyse data with greater speed, efficiency and understanding.

Before Power BI, getting a BI platform up and running in an organization would require a product like SQL Server Reporting or Analytics Services, which would usually mean upfront cost for hardware, licenses and consulting time. Once initial setup was completed there would also be the effort required to create the reporting models, reports and dashboards.

While the traditional reporting platform lives on, there is a new way with a zero start-up costs that can have organizations up and running in under day. Power BI.
