# DevOps will bring **agility and consistency** to your business

DevOps is a natural progression from implementing good ALM. Building upon its ALM experience, SSW has developed expertise around implementing DevOps into a product's lifecycle. DevOps enables your organization to be more agile and helps bring a consistency that improves quality and allows you to be responsive to changes and issues. DevOps is more than just technology, it is a culture. The entire organization needs to buy in to get the most out of it. The goal is to get the product teams working with Developers, who are in turn working with Operations, who are working with testers and providing feedback.
