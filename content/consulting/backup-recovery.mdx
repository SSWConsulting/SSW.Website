# The benefits of having a great Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan

##### Businesses often take their critical line of business applications and systems for granted, and assume that they will always be there, but in the case of a natural or human induced disaster, the fallout can be crippling if not managed well. This could range from staff not able to work for a period of time, to a full loss of customer data and business intellectual property.

SSW can assist in the design and implementation of a Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan to meet your business requirements.
