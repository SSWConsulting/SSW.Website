## Craft Your Intranet Strategy with Expert Insights

Understanding your organization's needs and challenges is crucial before embarking on a SharePoint intranet project. SSW's SharePoint Intranet Assessment service provides you with a detailed SharePoint plan, structure and strategic roadmap, enabling informed decisions about your intranet's future.

Our assessment is designed to evaluate your current intranet (if applicable) or conceptualize a new SharePoint-based solution tailored to your organization's unique requirements, leveraging Azure services for enhanced performance and scalability.
