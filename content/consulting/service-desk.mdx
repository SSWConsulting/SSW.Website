# The Benefits of having an external Service Desk

There are many advantages to outsourcing your IT Service Desk:

#####

1. Potential costs savings as you are only paying for support when you need it
2. No paying for IT Professional's salary or benefits
3. Skills and experience of multiple people rather than a small inhouse team
    24/7 support available
4. Centralized source of IT information and help
5. Management of IT hardware purchasing from a knowledgeable team
