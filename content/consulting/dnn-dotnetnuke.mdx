# The benefits of  **DotNetNuke**

DotNetNuke (DNN) is an open source ASP.NET-based content management system (CMS) used to create easy-to-use, updatable, customizable, and secure content management portals. It is ideal for creating and deploying projects such as commercial websites, corporate intranets and extranets, online publishing portals, and custom vertical applications. DNN provides automated content management capabilities and tools to maintain a dynamic and 100% interactive data-driven website.

This collaborative project is quickly becoming the industry standard for scalable portal deployments on the Microsoft platform, with a growing community of over 200,000 users and a dedicated base of programming professionals. SSW is proud to have developed some of the most beautiful DotNetNuke sites in Australia.
