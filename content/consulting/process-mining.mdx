Battling with tedious, error-prone processes? Common examples include HR onboarding, data entry, accounting, and many more. Fortunately, the sooner you improve your processes, the greater the reward - efficiencies and cost reductions compound over time. After repeating this countless times for clients, we’ve found the most effective approach (we do this internally too!).

First, we identify your unique challenges and painful processes. Second, we select the most important processes and map them using traditional mapping techniques and cutting-edge tools such as process mining and event-storming. Third, we eliminating bureaucracy and redundancy in each process. Fourth, we add automation in the form of customized workflows, often using [AI](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/artificial-intelligence) and [Power
Automate](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/power-platform).

As we work, your feedback constantly guides us. The end result is an effective system for your operations that not only automates tasks but merges smoothly with your business objectives.
