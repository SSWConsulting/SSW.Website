Process improvement
is essential for a modern business
----------------------------------

<VideoEmbed url="https://youtu.be/0TcGVvAiE84" />

Battling with tedious, error-prone processes? Every business has tasks they wish could be smoother. Common examples are HR onboarding, data entry and reporting, accounting, customer support, and many more. 

Fortunately, the sooner you invest in process improvement, the greater the reward since efficiencies and cost reductions compound over time.

After repeating this process internally and for clients, we’ve found the most effective approach has four steps:

First, we identify your unique challenges and pinpoint painful processes.

Second, we select the most important processes and map them using both traditional mapping techniques and cutting-edge tools such as process mining and event storming.

Third, we improve each process by eliminating bureaucracy and redundancy. 

Fourth, we add automation in the form of customized workflows, often using [AI](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/artificial-intelligence) and [Power
Automate](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/power-platform).

Usually, changes begin with streamlining processes and end with automation– so that improvements are effective and automation is used where it is most valuable.

As we work, your feedback constantly guides us. This way, the result is an effective system for your operations that not only automates tasks but aligns smoothly with your business objectives.
