**Process improvement**
is essential for a modern business
==================================

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q9lLqtkC00" caption="The Future of Business with AI: Automation, Intelligence, and Customer Relations | Ulysses Maclaren" duration="10 mins" />

Every business battles with tedious and error-prone processes. Common examples include HR onboarding, data entry, and accounting. Fortunately, the sooner you improve processes, the greater the reward - efficiencies and cost reductions compound over time. After applying business process improvement techniques countless times for clients, we have mastered it. This is so important that we do it internally every chance we get.

First, we identify your challenges and painful processes. Second, we choose the most important processes and map them using traditional mapping techniques, and cutting-edge ones such as process mining and event-storming. Third, we eliminate bureaucracy and redundancy in each process as much as possible. Fourth, we add automation to the improved process in the form of customized workflows, often using [AI](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/artificial-intelligence) and [Power
Automate](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/power-platform).

During the process, your feedback constantly guides us. The end result is categorically more efficient workflows from which you can immediately see time and cost benefits.
