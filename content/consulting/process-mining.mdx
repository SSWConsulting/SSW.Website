**Process improvement**
is essential for a modern business
==================================

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q9lLqtkC00" />

Every business battles with tedious, error-prone processes. Common examples include HR onboarding, data entry, accounting, and many more. Fortunately, the sooner you improve processes, the greater the reward - efficiencies and cost reductions compound over time. After repeating this countless times for clients, we’ve constantly improved our approach to perfect it. This is so important that we do it internally every chance we get.

First, we identify challenges and painful processes. Second, we choose the most important processes and map them using traditional mapping techniques and cutting-edge tools such as process mining and event-storming. Third, we eliminate bureaucracy and redundancy in each process. Fourth, if necessary, we add automation in the form of customized workflows, often using [AI](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/artificial-intelligence) and [Power
Automate](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/power-platform).

During the process, your feedback constantly guides us. The end result is categorically more efficient workflows from which you can immediately see time and cost benefits.
