React is a JavaScript library that combines the speed of JavaScript with new ways of rendering web pages, making them highly dynamic and responsive to user input. This technology significantly changed Facebook approach to development. After the library was released as an open-source tool, it became extremely popular due to its revolutionary approach to programming user interfaces.

React encourages the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over time.

React can also render on the server using Node.js, and it can power native mobile apps using React Native.
