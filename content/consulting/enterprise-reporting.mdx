# The benefits of **Business Intelligence and Reporting**

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NTrH4hzbbE" caption="Power BI vs Reporting Services with Dave Paylor and Ulysses Maclaren - DWC Conference 2017" duration="6 mins" />

Enterprise report management is a methodology that involves providing substantial information to the managers in an organization to help them make business decisions. The main goal of enterprise reporting or management reporting is to supply important timely information to managers in an effective way. The reports generally take the form of graphs, text, and tables. Sometimes information may also be distributed on the Internet in the form of updated Web pages, also known as enterprise portals.

Business intelligence (BI) is a technology-driven process for analysing data and presenting actionable information to help executives, managers, and other corporate end users make informed business decisions.
