# The benefits of an **SSW Support Plan**

SSW has built and supported thousands of applications over 3 decades, and we
know the best way to support your key systems.

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35vWStpYIY0" caption="Support Plans - Peace of mind in case of an emergency" duration="5 mins" />

SSW Support Plans are designed to cater to customers with mission-critical systems, ensuring their operations stay uninterrupted, secure, and optimized for speed.

Diverging from traditional support options, our Support Plans stand out as cost-effective solutions that enable clients to wield control over their support experience. By granting them the authority to determine the urgency with which each issue is resolved, we put the power in their hands, ensuring a tailored and efficient support journey.

We guarantee swift attention to each concern.  Your priorities become our priorities, as we work diligently to address issues in a timely and efficient manner.

The SSW Support Plan charges a small monthly fee and in return SSW creates all
of the tooling, dashboards and infrastructure so that clients can rest easy
knowing all of SSW's technical staff have access to all of the client's
necessary information. SSW have always been a reliable support partner and
this plan we believe is a better alternative to high reoccurring monthly fees
that offer little value to well-built software.

We stand behind the software we build and offer Support Plans to all of our
clients. We also offer Support Plans on software built by others, so that
everyone can have access to SSW's depth of experience.
