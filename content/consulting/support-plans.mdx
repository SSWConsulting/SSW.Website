# The benefits of an **SSW Support Plan**

SSW has built and supported thousands of applications over 3 decades, and we
know the best way to support your key systems.

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35vWStpYIY0" />

SSW Support Plans were created to help our customers who have mission critical
systems remain up, secure and fast. Unlike Support Plans offered elsewhere, SSW
Support Plans help our customers lower cost by asking the client to assess the
priority of each issue and pay a small premium on the developers hourly rate.
In return, SSW will make sure the issue is addressed ASAP even if key developers
are booked elsewhere. The customer chooses how quickly each issue is dealt with.

The SSW Support Plan charges a small monthly fee and in return SSW creates all
of the tooling, dashboards and infrastructure so that clients can rest easy
knowing all of SSW's technical staff have access to all of the client's
necessary information. SSW have always been a reliable support partner and
this plan we believe is a better alternative to high reoccurring monthly fees
that offer little value to well-built software.

We stand behind the software we build and offer Support Plans to all of our
clients. We also offer Support Plans on software built by others, so that
everyone can have access to SSW's depth of experience.
