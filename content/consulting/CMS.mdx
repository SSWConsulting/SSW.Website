# The benefits of using a **CMS**

Content Management Systems allow for anyone in your organization to publish content painlessly. Whether for your public website, press releases, or internal business portals, content can be drafted as easily as writing an email. Enterprise capabilities such as version control, and workflow, mean the right content gets delivered at the right time, in keeping with company policies.
