## Boost your customer communication with AI

A well-built chatbot can offer your business a whole range of benefits. SSW's AI-powered chatbots harness advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize customer service by enabling reliable and timely communication. With a robust database to build its knowledge from, this highly responsive solution is much more cost-effective than its predecessors.

SSW will work with you to determine the style of chatbot that best suits your business's needs, harnessing industry-leading frameworks like Azure Open AI (with GPT). With two developers working in unison, your new chatbot can be live on your website in just one day.

SSW Solution Architect, [Matt Goldman](https://ssw.com.au/people/matt-goldman/ "Matt's People Page") wrote the book on .NET MAUI. Watch more below:
