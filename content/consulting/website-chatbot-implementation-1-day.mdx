In addition to enhancing customer interactions, custom AI chatbots can also help businesses gather valuable insights from the data they collect. By analyzing customer interactions and behavior patterns, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their target audience and make informed decisions to drive growth and innovation. With the right data strategy in place, businesses can harness the power of AI to unlock new opportunities and stay ahead of the competition.

## Our Client Stories

[French Payroll Expert](https://frenchpayrollexpert.fr/) (FPE) is a company specializing in payroll management for foreign companies operating in France. The laws around foreign companies hiring French resources are complex, ever changing, and all written in French. Because of this, FPE faced a high volume of inquiries from their clients about French legislation. The time spent responding to these time-consuming emails was a resource our client knew they could save, especially with the emergence of artificial intelligence.
