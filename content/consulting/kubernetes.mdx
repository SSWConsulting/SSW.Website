      title: MULTI-CLOUD PLATFORMS
      description: >
        Build once, run it anywhere! A major benefit is its portability. It
        enables you to easily and reliably run applications on different
        environments. This reduces vendor lock-in with a specific cloud
        provider, giving you the ability to migrate easily if the need arises.

      title: RAPID STARTUP
      description: >
        A spike in incoming traffic? No problem! New containers will start up
        rapidly because they are running the application, and not booting a
        whole operating system. Containers can also start up on different nodes
        of your cluster, allowing your service to naturally balance load across
        all available nodes.

      title: REDUCED RUNNING COSTS
      description: >
        Containers run more efficiently by packing applications in tighter,
        reducing overheads and making better use of your existing resources. It
        allows companies to save on everything from server costs to the
        employees needed to maintain them. Fewer resources, more automation!

      title: CONSISTENCY
      description: >
        Images contain all the dependencies required to run an application. As
        such, Development, Staging and Production all run identical
        environments. This provides huge benefits in identifying and resolving
        issues quickly and you will never hear "It works on my machine" again.

      title: OPERATIONAL SIMPLICITY
      description: >
        Containers are designed from the ground up be built and deployed
        automatically. Since containers package up all their dependencies, you
        no longer need to ensure that the correct libraries are installed on
        each environment. That makes it is a breeze to migrate between
        environments. Your servers should be cattle, not pets.

      title: ISOLATION AND SECURITY
      description: >
        It ensures your applications and resources are isolated and segregated.
        Docker, for example, makes sure each container has its own resources
        that are isolated from other containers, granting you complete control
        over traffic flow and management.

# The benefits of **Kubernetes containers**

<VideoEmbed url="https://youtu.be/J-xyKoYW4Pc" caption="Kubernetes to revolutionize your app" duration="30 seconds" />

A container bundles everything your application needs to run, including the code, runtime, system tools and system libraries. It makes it possible to deploy an application just about anywhere without any requirements about what exists on the destination computer where the application will be running!

Once your application has been built to run in a container, it can be easily hosted with any provider that supports containers, including Kubernetes and Azure Web Apps.
