          title: FAST ANSWERS – SAVE TIME
          description: With Natural Language Processing, bots can understand both written and verbal requests across different locations such as Slack, Skype, Google Assistant, or even on your website. They can be used to answer questions from your team or your client. You can seek help from bots wherever and whenever you want.

          title: INCREASE SALES
          description: If you have an ecommerce site, your bot can also suggest or remember products that your client has already searched for. It can also offer a special code as a strategy to reduce your abandonment rate and increase sales.

          title: EASY INTEGRATION WITH COMMON APPS OR ENTERPRISE SERVICES
          description: More and more people are using instant messaging over browsing websites and social media profiles. In addition, people tend to keep using the main apps they already have (such as Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, etc) to get customer service. If you want a chatbot for your website, you could simply integrate your system into common and existing apps.

          title: ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE 24/7 FOR YOUR CLIENTS
          description: Many businesses have 24-hour customer support, but if you have certain peak hours, a customer will still have to wait to get in touch with an agent that can help them. Bots don't have unexpected meetings, they don't get tired or sick and will continue providing assistance to your clients or your team.

          description: Automation is one of the most significant key factors in enhancing work efficiency. With the help of bots, you can automate mundane tasks and have them enter data for you.

SSW build awesome bots for enterprises giving you an advantage in finding and automatically entering data using advanced business grade artificial intelligence, as well as helping your team complete tasks more effectively.

Your bots promote an effective and productive workplace - many companies are already using bots more than doing searches on their intranet.

## What kind of bots do you need?
Many industries can benefit from having their own bots in many different ways. Here are some ideas of how a bot can improve your business results:

### Customer service bots
If you are either selling a service or a product, you can provide 24/7 customer service without worrying about unexpected problems with your team, as bots are always ready to help.

### Human resources bots
You can use bots at every stage, all the way from onboarding, to ongoing training and support.

### Marketing & Branding bots
Your Marketing team can use a bot to surface the data they need to provide them with insights to improve their strategies. To raise awareness about your brand, you can have bots on your social media starting conversations with your clients.

### Sales & Finance bots
To increase your online sales, you can have a bot reminding a client they have items left in their cart or even offering a special coupon. To help your business’ finance, they can do everything from general accounting to financial planning and external reporting.

This is beyond the personal bots that you may know e.g. Google Assistant, Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa or Microsoft Cortana. They are famous for their powerful natural language processing performance and are available on PCs as well as mobile apps.
Now imagine what your own business' Siri/Alexa could do for you.
