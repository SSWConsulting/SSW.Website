      title: FAST ANSWERS – SAVE TIME
      description: >
        With Natural Language Processing, bots can understand both written and
        verbal requests across different locations such as Slack, Skype, Google
        Assistant, or even on your website. They can be used to answer questions
        from your team or your client. You can seek help from bots wherever and
        whenever you want.

      title: INCREASE SALES
      description: >
        If you have an ecommerce site, your bot can also suggest or remember
        products that your client has already searched for. It can also offer a
        special code as a strategy to reduce your abandonment rate and increase
        sales.

      title: EASY INTEGRATION WITH COMMON APPS OR ENTERPRISE SERVICES
      description: >
        More and more people are using instant messaging over browsing websites
        and social media profiles. In addition, people tend to keep using the
        main apps they already have (such as Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp,
        Skype, etc) to get customer service. If you want a chatbot for your
        website, you could simply integrate your system into common and existing
        apps.

      title: ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE 24/7 FOR YOUR CLIENTS
      description: >
        Many businesses have 24-hour customer support, but if you have certain
        peak hours, a customer will still have to wait to get in touch with an
        agent that can help them. Bots don't have unexpected meetings, they
        don't get tired or sick and will continue providing assistance to your
        clients or your team.

      title: 'EFFICIENCY, AUTOMATED'
      description: >
        Automation is one of the most significant key factors in enhancing work
        efficiency. With the help of bots, you can automate mundane tasks and
        have them enter data for you.

# **Bots** in action

<VideoEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_v5B_gYceM" caption="Microsoft’s Semantic Machines Showcases New Conversational AI Technology" duration="3 mins" />

SSW's AI consultants have experience building awesome bots using [advanced business grade artificial intelligence for enterprises](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/artificial-intelligence). Your bots promote an effective and productive workplace - many companies are already using bots more than doing searches on their intranet.

AI technology can give you advantages in finding and automatically entering data to help your team benefit from the AI efficiency boost!

## What kind of bots do you need?

Many industries can benefit from having their own bots in many different ways. Here are some ideas of how a bot can improve your business:

### Customer service bots

If you are either selling a service or a product, you can provide 24/7 customer service without worrying about unexpected problems with your team, as AI bots are always ready to help.

### Human resources bots

You can use bots at every stage, all the way from onboarding to ongoing training and support.

### Marketing & Branding bots

Your Marketing team can use a bot to surface the data they need to provide them with insights to improve their strategies. To raise awareness about your brand, you can have bots on your social media starting conversations with your clients.

### Sales & Finance bots

To increase your online sales, you can have a bot reminding a client they have items left in their cart or even offering a special coupon. To help your business’ finance, they can do everything from general accounting to financial planning and external reporting.

This is beyond the personal bots that you may know e.g. Google Assistant, Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa or Microsoft Cortana. They are famous for their powerful natural language processing performance and are available on PCs as well as mobile apps.
Now imagine what your own business' Siri/Alexa could do for you.

Meanwhile, in office management, Sophie AI from SSW is a good example of an enterprise grade bot that is very useful for office workers. [See SSW Sophie AI](https://sswsophie.com/).
