# The benefits of **upsizing your Access database**

If you are experiencing connection, speed and data corruption issues with Microsoft Access, then there is a way to solve them all. It's called 'upsizing'.

Upsizing involves moving the Access database to SQL Server. The user interface stays the same, but the backend database is moved to a more robust platform.

SSW provides migration services to companies ranging from small businesses through to corporate. We can migrate old large systems with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and hundreds of tables and forms.
