# The benefits of **upsizing your Access database**

If you are experiencing connection, speed and data corruption issues with Microsoft Access, then there is a way to solve them all. It's called 'upsizing'.

Upsizing involves moving the Access database to SQL Server. The user interface stays the same, but the backend database is moved to a more robust platform.
