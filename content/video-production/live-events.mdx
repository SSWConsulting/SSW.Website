## Overview

Using the latest technologies and with coaching from our media team SSW can create an innovative video of your presentation. This can be a really cost effective way of establishing yourself or an employee as an industry expert. One of the first to try it in the Software Industry, SSW has been creating presentation videos since 2009. It’s a great option if you are hosting a meeting/conference and have attendees situated across the country or internationally.

Live streaming can be a great way to interact with a remote audience, in addition to the live audience. It might seem as easy as operating a Facebook account at first glance but when it comes down to it, it’s still a fairly new technology and it’s still very technical, especially if you want multiple cameras and/or computer screen feeds etc. so you need an expert that knows the ins and outs and can create a steady, professional live streaming setup. That’s us!

## Going onsite - Live Stream your Event at your location

If you are already running a conference or event that you would like make available to a wider audience, we can come onsite and livestream your event. This would be suitable for conference sessions, user groups, AGMs, important company meetings, school or church events, or educational presentations.

An indicative price for livestreaming an event like this would be approximately $9,000 AUD + GST per day.
