Educational marketing is the new way to build company/brand trust and loyalty. If you deliver viewers what they want to see and expand their knowledge by sharing yours, you are then seen as an expert in your field and thus earn trust from colleagues, clients and industry associates. This increases your marketing efforts meaning more clients are driven to your business, increasing overall profits. 80% of a product or business’s success is dependent on marketing, so you want to get it right. Not only do we do this for our clients but we employ this technique for ourselves with [SSW TV](http://tv.ssw.com/), so we know the territory well.
