##  SSW Actions

To further ensure the integrity and effectiveness of our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) practices, SSW will convene a regular meeting led by a small, diverse team. The objective of this review is to.

* Thoroughly review the SSW DEI policy to ensure it remains robust and reflective of our evolving company culture and societal standards.
* Recognise special days and events that are significant to our diverse workforce, ensuring these occasions are acknowledged and celebrated company-wide.
* Affirm that individuals at SSW with special needs are not only recognised but also supported through practical and thoughtful accommodations, fostering an environment of accessibility and inclusivity.
*  Evaluate the effectiveness of DEI messaging and education provided to all staff, identifying any areas for improvement or additional support, and establishing follow-up actions as necessary.
* This proactive approach underscores our commitment to not just having a policy in place but also living out the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of our work at SSW.
