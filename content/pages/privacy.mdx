### Contacting us about privacy

If you would like more information about the way SSW manage personal information that SSW hold about you, or are concerned that SSW may have breached your privacy, please contact us by email or by post.

#### Access to your personal information

In most cases, you may have access to personal information that SSW hold about you. SSW will handle requests for access to your personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles. All requests for access to your personal information must be directed to the Privacy Officer by email or by writing to us at our postal address. SSW will deal with all requests for access to personal information as quickly as possible. Requests for a large amount of information, or information that is not currently in use, may require further time before a response can be given. SSW may charge you a fee for access if a cost is incurred by us in order to retrieve your information, but in no case will SSW charge you a fee for your application for access.

In some cases, SSW may refuse to give you access to personal information that SSW hold about you. This may include circumstances where giving you access would:

* be unlawful (eg, where a record that contains personal information about you is subject to a claim for legal professional privilege by one of our contractual counterparties);
* have an unreasonable impact on another person’s privacy; or
* prejudice an investigation of unlawful activity.

SSW may also refuse access where the personal information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings.

If SSW refuse to give you access, SSW will provide you with reasons for our refusal.

#### Correcting your personal information

SSW will amend any personal information about you that is held by us and that is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date if you request us to do so. If SSW disagree with your view about the accuracy, completeness or currency of a record of your personal information that is held by us, and you ask us to associate with that record a statement that you have a contrary view, SSW will take reasonable steps to do so.

### Storage and security of your personal information

SSW are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of the information that you provide us and SSW will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorized use or alteration. In our business, personal information may be stored both electronically (on our computer systems and with our Website hosting provider) and in hard-copy form.

### **GDPR**

SSW welcomes the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of the European Union (“EU”) as an important step forward in streamlining data protection globally.  SSW intend to comply with the data handling regime laid out in the GDPR in respect of any personal information of data subjects in the EU that SSW may obtain.

#### GDPR rights

The requirements of the GDPR are broadly similar to those set out in the Privacy Act and include the following rights:

* you are entitled to request details of the information that SSW hold about you and how SSW process it.
  For EU residents, SSW will provide this information for no fee;
* you may also have a right to:
  * have that information rectified or deleted;
  * restrict our processing of that information;
  * stop unauthorized transfers of your personal information to a third party;
  * in some circumstances, have that information transferred to another organization; and
  * lodge a complaint in relation to our processing of your personal information with a local supervisory authority; and
* where SSW rely upon your consent as our legal basis for collecting and processing your data, you may withdraw that consent at any time.

If you object to the processing of your personal information, or if you have provided your consent to processing and you later choose to withdraw it, SSW will respect that choice in accordance with our legal obligations.\
However, please be aware that:

* such objection or withdrawal of consent could mean that SSW are unable to provide our services to you, and could unduly prevent us from legitimately providing our services to other customers/clients subject to appropriate confidentiality protections; and
* even after you have chosen to withdraw your consent, SSW may be able to continue to keep and process your personal information to the extent required or otherwise permitted by law, in particular:
* to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact on your rights, freedoms or interests; and
* in exercising and defending our legal rights and meeting our legal and regulatory obligations.

#### Storage and processing by third parties

Data that SSW collect about you may be stored or otherwise processed by third party services with data centres based outside the EU, such as Google Analytics, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Apple, etc and online relationship management tools.
SSW consider that the collection and such processing of this information is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected (eg, to analyze how our customers/clients use our services, develop our services and grow our business) and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
SSW requires that all third parties that act as “data processors” for us provide sufficient guarantees and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure your data, only process personal data for specified purposes and have committed themselves to confidentiality.

#### Duration of retention of your data

SSW will only keep your data for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, subject to satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.  At the end of any retention period, your data will either be deleted completely or anonymized (for example, by aggregation with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning).  In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data.

#### Keeping your information up-to-date

To ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date, please promptly advise us of any changes to your information by contacting our data protection officer by email or by post.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

From time to time, it may be necessary for us to revise this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be in accordance with any applicable requirements under the Privacy Act and the Australian Privacy Principles. SSW may notify you about changes to this Privacy Policy by posting an updated version on this site.
