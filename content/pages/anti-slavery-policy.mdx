#### Introduction and Commitment

SSW is an Australian-based software consultancy with over 34 years of
experience. We are deeply committed to upholding human rights and eradicating
all forms of modern slavery within our operations and supply chains. Our global
presence includes offices in Australia, China, and Europe, and we ensure that
all employees are treated with dignity, respect, and fairness.

#### Scope and Application

This policy applies to all of SSW’s operations, including our offices,
supply chains, and third-party partners worldwide. We are dedicated to
maintaining ethical standards across all levels of our business and expect the
same from those we work with.

#### Our Unique Talent Culture

At SSW, our employees are not just highly skilled professionals—they are
also influential thought leaders in the tech community. Many of our team
members regularly produce educational content, such as videos and blogs, which
have earned them a reputation as thought leaders. This visibility has made our
employees highly sought after by other companies. As a result, we are committed
to maintaining exceptional working conditions, competitive pay, and a strong
company culture to retain this top talent.

In China, our team members stand out even more due to their
technical expertise and strong English communication skills, making them
extremely valuable in the global market. Consequently, we offer exceptional
conditions to keep them on board, further demonstrating our commitment to
ethical labour practices.

#### Risk Assessment and Management

We regularly conduct risk assessments to identify and mitigate any
potential risks of modern slavery within our operations and supply chains. We
are proactive in monitoring and addressing these risks to ensure they do not
affect our business practices.

#### Employee Rights and Working Conditions

We value our employees highly and are committed to providing a work
environment that exceeds industry standards. Our team members are compensated
well above award wages, and we pride ourselves on fostering a culture where
people choose to stay because of the opportunities for growth, recognition, and
professional satisfaction.

#### Supplier and Partner Expectations

SSW is committed to working with suppliers and partners who share our
values. We expect all third-party partners to comply with our anti-slavery
standards, and we conduct due diligence to ensure these standards are met. We
are vigilant in monitoring our supply chains to prevent any form of
exploitation.

#### Training and Awareness

We provide regular training and awareness programs to our employees and
management to help them recognize and prevent modern slavery practices. This
training is an essential part of our commitment to ethical labour practices.
SSW has built and maintains its own learning platform called SugarLearning – [more

#### Reporting and Whistleblowing Mechanisms

We have established clear channels for reporting any suspected cases of
modern slavery. All reports are treated confidentially, and we ensure that
whistleblowers are protected from any retaliation.

#### Ongoing Monitoring and Improvement

SSW is committed to continually reviewing and improving our practices to
ensure that modern slavery and unethical labour practices have no place in our
business. We conduct regular audits and are always looking for ways to enhance
our policies and practices.

#### Compliance and Accountability

Compliance with this policy is mandatory for all SSW employees,
suppliers, and partners. We will monitor adherence to this policy and enforce
it through our internal processes, with consequences for non-compliance as
deemed necessary.
