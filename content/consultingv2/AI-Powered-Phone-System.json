This means development happens in iterative cycles (Sprints) with frequent opportunities for feedback.\n\nClient involvement is crucial – you (or a designated Product Owner) are considered an integral part of the team. You'll participate in regular meetings (like Sprint Reviews) to see progress, provide feedback, and help prioritize work, ensuring the final product aligns perfectly with your vision and needs.\n"
