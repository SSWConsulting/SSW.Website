    content: "> \"Logos are more important than we realise – a logo is often your first impression of a company and as such having a good one will go a long way to being memorable and instilling a sense of trust and familiarity. Our designers should be commended. We followed the same logo design process we do with clients where we had a brief, we did sketches, several iterations, and then a presentation to a small focus group.\n\n> Making changes to our much loved SSW logo has been a lengthy design consideration. SSW has been represented and branded by the popular 'swoosh' logo for nearly 20 years, but it was time for our logo to evolve alongside our growing company.\n\n> We could have started afresh, but we chose to keep the original company colors and the core feel. Therefore the swoosh was kept, as this has become the iconic symbol of SSW. We introduced a set of 4 small squares to the design, each in a varying shade of our corporate colors. The squares also highlight that we mainly work with the Microsoft stack.\n\n> I am proud to unveil the new SSW logo and believe this modern look will carry us further into the future.\"\\\n> \\\\\n\n-\_ADAM COGAN, SSW CHIEF ARCHITECT (POSTED ON\_[ADAM'S BLOG](https://adamcogan.com/2014/06/11/introducing-new-ssw-logo/))\n"

  - content: "## Background\n\nIn 2012 we launched a new SSW website with the influence of Windows 8 and Metro tiles. Our nearly 20 year old logo started to look dated.\n\nThen we began a serious effort to reinvent our branding for this new age of digital media.\n\n## Related Links\n\n* [SSW Typography & Web Design References](https://ssw.com.au/ssw/company/Web-Reference.aspx)\n* [Do you set design guidelines for your company?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/set-design-guidelines)\n\n## 2014 Logo Refresh\n\nOn the SSW new logo, you may just recognize several elements inspired from our original logo – the web, the globe and the \"swoosh\", as Adam Cogan loves to call it. Our goal was to retain the elements that made our company recognizable, but freshen it up with a Metro touch.\n\nWe kept the \"swoosh\" but replaced the globe and the web with the four squares as homage to our proud Microsoft affiliation.\n\nOf course we tightened the overall alignment and straightened the font - now using\_Helvetica Neue LT Pro 95.\n\nWe hope you like it!\n\n<CustomImage src=\"/images/company-logos/ssw-logo_evolution.png\" height={400} width={600} altText=\"Multiple logos\" />\n"

      ## How Not to Use


      Remember, the logo is a valuable corporate asset that must be used
      consistently in the proper, approved forms. There are some ways we also
      don’t want our logo used.


      #### Don't add effects, such as shadows, borders, gradients...
