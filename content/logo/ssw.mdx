    content: "> \"Logos are more important than we realise â€“ a logo is often your first impression of a company and as such having a good one will go a long way to being memorable and instilling a sense of trust and familiarity. Our designers should be commended. We followed the same logo design process we do with clients where we had a brief, we did sketches, several iterations, and then a presentation to a small focus group.\n\n> Making changes to our much loved SSW logo has been a lengthy design consideration. SSW has been represented and branded by the popular 'swoosh' logo for nearly 20 years, but it was time for our logo to evolve alongside our growing company.\n\n> We could have started afresh, but we chose to keep the original company colors and the core feel. Therefore the swoosh was kept, as this has become the iconic symbol of SSW. We introduced a set of 4 small squares to the design, each in a varying shade of our corporate colors. The squares also highlight that we mainly work with the Microsoft stack.\n\n> I am proud to unveil the new SSW logo and believe this modern look will carry us further into the future.\"\\\n> \\\\\n\n-\_ADAM COGAN, SSW CHIEF ARCHITECT (POSTED ON\_[ADAM'S BLOG](https://adamcogan.com/2014/06/11/introducing-new-ssw-logo/))\n"
