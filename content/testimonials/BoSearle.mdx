Just wanted to quickly to let you know that David has done a expeciational job for this project. given the challenging landscape of Vault's backend, he is always happy to hear the problems we have and trying his best to work around and find a solution for us. Nothing is ever too much for him so far! I really appreciate his ability to work with a non technical person (myself) to ensure we create a desirable outcome for this project.
