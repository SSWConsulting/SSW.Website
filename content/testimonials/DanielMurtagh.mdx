I just wanted to drop you a quick line to pass on my sincere thanks and appreciation for Jean's work.
He has been an absolute pleasure to work on our SharePoint development. He is polite, friendly, solutions focussed, open and honest. I have particularly appreciated his ability to take the time to understand our business needs and to implement solutions that are tailored and customised to suit our needs.
