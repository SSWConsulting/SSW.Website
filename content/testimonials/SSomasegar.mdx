Dear Adam Cogan,

Thank you for the work you've done over the last year to improve our products and help customers be successful. For those of you who were able to join me at the MVP Dinner earlier this month, I enjoyed meeting you face-to-face and very much appreciated hearing your stories. Hosting events like this one is one of my favorite parts of my role here at Microsoft.
With over 1,500 developer MVp's and fewer than 40 being recognized as an MVP of the year, you are truly one of our elite partners. Without you, we could not be as successful as we are today. To recognize the part you play, please find a token of our appreciation for all the work you do on Microsoft's behalf.
