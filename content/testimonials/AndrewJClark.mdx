I wanted to let you know how great it has been working with Kiki over the last two days. Kiki's work has been outstanding and he helped me through a couple of difficult conversations with the client that could have jeopardised the whole progress of not only the implementation of Zendesk but my whole project. Everything is now on track for success thanks to Kiki's work and more particularly his ability to handle an unexpected and tense situation with calm authority.
