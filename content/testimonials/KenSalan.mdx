We've commenced the production release of the new Auction Platform which each of you have played a role in developing.
While it's still in the early stages of release, so far it has been a great success. Our plan is to continue to monitor, enhance and increase its use over the coming 'busy' months, as we eventually look to phase out the existing system.
It has been a massive year of development and learning for all involved, and by all accounts, this is an application that will help set AuctionsPlus up for continued success, growth and service for years to come.
On behalf of @Angus and myself, we'd like to say congratulations and thanks for your efforts.
