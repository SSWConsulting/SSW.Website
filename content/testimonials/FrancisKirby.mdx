I think what the team has done has been great. They've been very responsive and receptive to feedback. The platform they've generated exceeds what I'd first envisioned (i.e., is much higher quality), and of course the fact that we're well below the original cost estimate is also awesome.
In summary, I think Chris, Alex, Joseph, and yourself have done an amazing job, and I'm looking forward to the internal testing and getting the wider teams feedback.
