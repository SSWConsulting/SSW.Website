Hi Marlon, I just wanted to pass on a note to express my praise for the effort and commitment both Daragh and William put in during the upgrade process and in particular last night/this morning.
The deployment went well, although a little longer than expected, they dug in their heels and powered through all 11 hours.
We got their at the end and the business is very happy with the results.
