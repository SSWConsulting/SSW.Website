Spent the last 2 days eating cookies, as well as learning more about clean architecture at SSW. To be honest I wasn't sure what to expect, as I think we do a pretty good job of Clean Architecture in our products. Both presenters did an amazing job and I am happy to say I walked away with quite a few learnings from the event. Now I just have a bit of homework to do on how I can apply them to improve our own products.
