Just completed an outstanding workshop on clean architecture with Luke Parker and Daniel Mackay from SSW. My team and I gained a ton of valuable insights!

Their expertise and engaging approach truly simplified complex concepts for us. We're now excited to put our new knowledge into practice.

Thanks, Luke Parker, Daniel Mackay, and the SSW team for this enriching experience! Highly recommended for anyone in the field.
