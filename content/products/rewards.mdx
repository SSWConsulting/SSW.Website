# SSW Rewards app

### Scan QR codes, earn points and win prizes!

The SSW app allows people to scan SSW employees' QR codes, see their points increase, and move up the leaderboard. When they have enough points, the app informs them of the prize that they just won. [More on Adam's Blog](https://adamcogan.com/2019/11/06/ssw-had-fun-at-ndc-gotta-catch-em-all/).

## About the project

SSW Rewards is an open source project and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rewards).

It comprises a mobile application written in .NET MAUI, with a Blazor-based web UI, and a backend implemented in ASP.NET Core - all using .NET 8!

If you're interested in customizing it for your business, [reach out to us at SSW](https://www.ssw.com.au/company/contact-us).

## Roadmap

* Support for TV leaderboard at conferences 
* Offline access 
* Better support for white labelling to allow companies to put their own branding to the app
