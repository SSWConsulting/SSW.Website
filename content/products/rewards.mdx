# SSW Rewards app

### Scan QR codes, earn points and win prizes!

The SSW app allows people to scan SSW employees' QR codes, see their
points increase, and move up the leaderboard. When they have enough points, the
app informs them of the prize that they just won. [More on Adam's Blog](https://adamcogan.com/2019/11/06/ssw-had-fun-at-ndc-gotta-catch-em-all/).
