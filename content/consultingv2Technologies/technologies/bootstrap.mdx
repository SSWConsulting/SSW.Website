Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end framework for designing websites and web applications. It works as a toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Bootstrap helps you quickly prototype your ideas and build your entire application with its official Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuild components, and powerful plugins build on jQuery.
