We use Hybrid development over per-platform native development. Hybrid development takes the web's most popular development frameworks and compiles the code into a native UI format for each relevant platform. This gives us the best of both worlds - fast development, code reuse, familiar technologies, and the performance and consistency of a native rendering.
