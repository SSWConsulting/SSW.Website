Experienced AI developers can share ideas with other experienced developers. If you’re a beginner, then there’s plenty to learn on the day.\n\nIf you then want to build something yourself, you’ll need some of the Microsoft AI and/or Machine Learning (ML) tools already setup and installed. If you’ve never played with AI or ML before it would be good to do a little bit of learning before the day but it’s not a requirement as all experience levels are welcome.",
