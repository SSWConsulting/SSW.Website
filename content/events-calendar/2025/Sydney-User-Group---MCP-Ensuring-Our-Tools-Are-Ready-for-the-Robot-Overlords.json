  "abstract": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly gaining traction as a pivotal standard for integrating LLMs with real-world tools and data sources. By providing a structured, context-rich interface, MCP enables AI agents to interact seamlessly with external systems, enhancing their utility and effectiveness.​\n\nIn this session, we'll delve into the core concepts of MCP, explore its architecture, and demonstrate how to build and publish your own MCP server. We'll also cover advanced features like Server-Sent events and the new A2A protocol, along with essential security considerations.​\nWhether you're currently working with AI or planning to, this talk will equip you with the knowledge to make your systems LLM-compatible.",
