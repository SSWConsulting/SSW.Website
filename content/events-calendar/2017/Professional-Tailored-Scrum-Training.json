For example, you may have certified Professional Scrum Developers and Professional Scrum Masters within your organisation, in which case we can tailor a course targeting non-technical personal such as department managers, business stakeholders and executives. Or your organisation may not have any Scrum expertise, in which case we can tailor a course to train Developers, Scrum Masters, Business Stakeholders, Executives and anyone else who may benefit, effectively bringing all parties within your organisation together, dispelling myths, giving a clear understanding of who does what and how Scrum will work for you.\u200b<br></p><p><br></p></div>",
