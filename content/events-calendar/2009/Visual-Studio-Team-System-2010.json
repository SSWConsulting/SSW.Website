Visual Studio Team System 2010 in conjunction with Team Foundation Server attempts to rectify this by unifying the underlying flow of information between design, development and test disciplines. In this session Stephen Godbold will highlight the enhancements made to the Team System offering that will drive up quality through a single source of truth and a shared application view across teams.
