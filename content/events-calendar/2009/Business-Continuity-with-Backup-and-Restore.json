In the event of a system failure or user error, the Backup and Restore commands provide the ability to recover from what otherwise could be a catastrophe. With the release of SQL server 2005 and 2008 these commands have been enhanced significantly. For example, the ability to take an adhoc backup without affecting the restore sequence and the ability to revert a database from a snapshot.
