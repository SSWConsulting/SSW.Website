In fact, modern developers should be doing Clean Testing.<br><br>Systems that adhere to the principles of Clean Architecture are independent of UIs, databases, frameworks, and other external concerns. As a result, the domain and business logic, the most important parts of the system, are completely isolated from external concerns. This makes&#160;writing automated tests, a whole lot easier.<br><br>In this talk, join Jason Taylor from SSW as he uncovers a simplified approach to automated testing with Clean Architecture. You will learn about unit tests, integration tests, and subcutaneous tests, along with tools, frameworks, and most importantly, where to focus your efforts. You leave this talk fully prepared to implement your own simplified approach to automated testing with Clean Architecture.<br><br>ABOUT THE PRESENTER<br><br>Jason Taylor is a solution architect, trainer, mentor, and full stack developer with 20 years professional experience. Currently specializing in teaching and building enterprise applications utilizing .NET Core, Angular, Vue, and Azure. Jason loves a challenge and is skilled at progressing from a simple proposal into a well-defined, coded, and tested solution.<br><br>Jason loves public speaking and has run the .NET Core Superpowers to sold out audiences in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne.\u200b\u200b<br></p></div>",
