  "description": ".NET User Group:\u00a0Beyond Passwords: The Future (and Present) of Authentication\n\nWe all know passwords are not fit for purpose, and we're slowly making our way to a \"post-password\" world. Passwords are a problem for security, convenience, and accessibility, and the future of authentication won't involve passwords at all.\n\nThere are already many options available to take passwords out of the picture for your authentication scenarios. We're all used to our phones and computers letting us login with our faces or fingers, and organisations like the FIDO alliance are building the foundations of the password-free future.\n\nBy using existing and well-established technologies, we can provide secure, convenient, passwordless authentication for our users.
