Of course you won\u2019t miss out on what best practices you should follow to ensure your DevOps cycle is running like a well-oiled machine. You will also learn how great tools like TFS (for orchestration), Octopus Deploy or Release Management (for deployment), SonarQube (for managing technical debt) and Docker (for app isolation) help you in that manner.&#160;</p></div>",
