Actually we care about it some much that we have built a tool named Code Auditor which scans code and reports issues. It\u2019s not really a secret that our rules relied on C# snippets and Regex patterns. Over time - as the C# language evolved - we started seeing false positives. Yikes! Then we met Roslyn \u2013 the new .NET compiler platform \u2013 which opened a new dimension in Code Analysis world. We drive Mercedes now. Want to have a test drive? Join me in this session and you\u2019ll learn what Roslyn can do for you. Forget the demos, see the real world code.</p></div>",
