And they do it with software that leverages your existing telecommunications infrastructure. Microsoft unified communications technologies are more than just VoIP. They break down all the traditional communications silos. Voicemail and faxes move over the network like email. They arrive in your Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 inbox where you can sort, prioritize, and forward them, just like any piece of email. And when you're on the road, you can dial in over any telephone to hear your emails and your calendars. You can even access your Microsoft Office Outlook directory and place calls from any telephone. Also hear about customising and extending the capabilities of the newly released Office Communicator 2007. The session will also cover the API solutions available to integrate Unified communications concepts into your line of business applications and business processes.</span><br></p></div>",
