These patterns can then be used to derive knowledge about data, and in turn this knowledge can be used to enhance application designs and the user experience. In this presentation, Peter Myers will present an overview of SQL Server 2005 Data Mining and will demonstrate how to develop data mining models that can be embedded into your applications. Demonstrations will be based on SQL Server 2005 Data Mining, using .NET Windows and web development. This presentation is a must for any developer looking to embed &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; into their solution design to take their applications to the next level. It is guaranteed to thrill you with potential, and excite you with the ease in which it can be accomplished. Note that there is no requirement that attendees have any data mining background.</p><p style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;word-break&#58;break-word;font-family&#58;arial, sans-serif;font-size&#58;14px;background-color&#58;#ffffff;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing&#58;border-box;\">About the Presenter&#58;</strong>&#160;Peter Myers is a freelance BI practitioner, trainer and presenter.
