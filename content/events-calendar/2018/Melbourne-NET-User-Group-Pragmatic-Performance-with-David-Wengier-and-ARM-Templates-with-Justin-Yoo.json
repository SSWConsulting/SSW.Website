And if the time is right, what are you actually supposed to do?\n\nIf you're interested to hear about a pragmatic approach to performance, this talk will explain when is the right time to think about benchmarking, but more importantly will run through how to correctly benchmark .NET code so any decisions made will be based on information about your code that is trustworthy.\n\nAdditionally, you'll also find out about some of the common, and some of the unknown, performance pitfalls of the .NET Framework and we'll discuss the true meaning behind the phrase \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\".\n\nTalk #2: Lessons learned: Best practices writing ARM templates - Justin Yoo\n\nAn ARM template is a convenient tool to manage Azure resources, but it is very difficult to manage them, and can be time consuming unless it is efficiently written. In addition, an ARM template is a big JSON file that is hard to read. What if DevOps engineers could write them in YAML? How about testing them efficiently? Lifecycle management?
