Because of this many operators have adopted the concept of Infrastructure as Code, where you model and create infrastructure using a highly declarative language similar to application code.\n\nIn this session, I will introduce Terraform from HashiCorp, an infrastructure as code tool that allows you to provision IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS across multiple cloud providers.\n\nWe will explore how Terraform can help you when deploying systems to Azure, and how you can see and approve the changes Terraform will make to your Azure resources.\n\nWe'll also look at how Terraform can help create reusable and shareable infrastructure code using Modules, and demonstrate how you can access information about existing infrastructure not provisioned by Terraform.\n\nAt the end of this session, attendees will have an understanding of Terraform's DSL and core workflows; and how Terraform can be used to make changes safely to any infrastructure on any platform.\n\nAbout the presenter:\n\nTom\u2019s an Engineer at HashiCorp working on the Azure support within Terraform.
