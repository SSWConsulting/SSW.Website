Innovation continues at a mind-bending pace, and this presentation will showcase some thought-provoking new directions that Web Services are headed in (imagine computers programmatically calling people to perform tasks), as well as introduce a concept known as \u201cWeb Scale Computing? The presentation will also provide an overview of Amazon Web Services, and feature a code demonstration showing how .NET developers are able to easily integrate data storage in the sky as part of an ASP.NET application. More importantly, it\u2019s an opportunity for an interactive discussion about what the future, shaped by Web services and Web Scale Computing, looks like. Amazon spent over 11 years and over $2 billion developing a world-class technology and content platform that powers Amazon web sites for millions of customers. Most people think &quot;Amazon.com&quot; when they hear the word; however developers are excited to learn that there is a separate technology arm of the company, known as Amazon Web Services or AWS. Using AWS, developers can build software applications leveraging the same robust, scalable, and reliable technology that powers Amazon\u2019s retail business. AWS has now launched ten services with open API\u2019s for developers to build applications, with the result that over 290,000 developers have registered on Amazon\u2019s developer site to create applications based on these services. Mike Culver joined Amazon Web Services after almost eight years in evangelism at Microsoft, where he saw .NET move from a provocative idea to the preeminent development platform for serious development. As an Amazon Evangelist, Mike works in the Developer Relations Group of Amazon Web Services. In that capacity he once again helps developers take advantage of cutting-edge technologies that are going to change the way we think about computer applications.</span><br></p></div>",
