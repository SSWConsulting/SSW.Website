Unfortunately, not every project is a green fields project, and most organisations have at least a few applications running on Web Forms that need to be maintained.<br><br>Starting a brand new project in MVC is easy, but moving to MVC from an existing Web Forms application isn\u2019t a trivial decision. It would be madness to ignore the years of investment you\u2019ve already made in your Web Forms application. Even if you\u2019re happy to throw all that old code away and start anew, is your manager similarly enthusiastic?<br><br>Nobody wants to be stuck on old technology, but you also don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019ve wasted the last few years!<br><br>Are you looking to build websites that can run on desktop and mobile devices with little extra effort?<br><br>In this webinar, I\u2019ll show you how you can move forward with ASP.NET MVC without losing the investment you\u2019ve already made with Web Forms. You\u2019ll be able to start working with the \u201cnew shiny\u201d without incurring the wrath of your users and managers by rebuilding everything from scratch.</div></div>",
