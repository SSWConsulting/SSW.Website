    The importance of monitoring and managing student safety has never been more
    prominent, nor topical. As an independent school or university you have a
    clear duty of care to your students – as well as an obligation to the
    parents and carers who are part of your school community. Following the 2017
    Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse, you also now have a detailed set
    of recommendations for ensuring child safety and protecting students’
    welfare and wellbeing. As technology specialists, we are focused on

    schools, of all sizes and in all sectors, respond to these requirements and

### Overview

The importance of monitoring and managing student safety has never been more prominent, nor topical. As an independent school (or university) you have a clear duty of care to your students – as well as an obligation to the parents and carers who are part of the community. Following the 2017 Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse, you also now have a detailed set of recommendations for ensuring child safety and protecting students’ welfare and wellbeing. Yet while your school may be resolutely committed to following these recommendations, it can be hard to know where to start when it comes to putting them into action – or what processes and technology platforms you need.

This is where SSW can help. As technology specialists, we are focused on designing and building modern technology solutions that can help K-12 schools, of all sizes and in all sectors, respond to these requirements and enhance all-important student safety. View some of our educational clients.

### How SSW can help: Customised Technology Solutions

At SSW, we have designed three broad technology solutions that can help you achieve positive outcomes with regards to your students’ safety and wellbeing. We recognise that no two schools are the same, and can customise every solution to suit your specific needs. We can also create a whole raft of other solutions depending on your school's (or university's) existing technology and unique requirements.
