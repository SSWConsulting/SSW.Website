      **Headings** â€“ Next to each heading, note in (parentheses) an HTML title tag - H1 for the main title (only 1 per page) H2 for subheadings, H3 etc... Each heading must include keywords.  
        
          * [Example](https://www.ssw.com.au/industry/educational):  
          
          (H1) SSW Educational  
          
          (H2) Overview  
          
          (H2) How SSW can help: Customized technology solutions


      **Images** â€“ Under each image, note the caption and alt text (describes the image to search engines)  
      
      Tip: Use an [alt text generator](https://alttext.in/)

          * Example:  
          
          Image - <cat-flying.jpg>  
          
          Caption - Figure: A cat soars majestically above New York City.  
          
          Alt text - cat flying above city  
  

      **Text** - where possible, add links or hyperlinks to relevant SSW pages. 'Internal linking' gives pages credibility for search engines.  

          * Example:
